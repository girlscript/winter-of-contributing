    <h2>Display:flex</h2>
    <p>This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.</p>
<h2>Flex Direction</h2>
<p>This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.</p>

<h2>Justify Content</h2>
<p>This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.</p>

  <h2>Align Item</h2>
<p>This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).</p>
