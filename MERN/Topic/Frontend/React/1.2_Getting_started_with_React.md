# **Getting started with React**

## **Tools You Will Need for React development environment**
<br>

1. ### **Install Node.js and npm :**

    **Node.js** and **npm** are the runtime and command-line tools required to build and run React applications.
    **Node.js** is a javascript runtime environment that enables you to run js code outside of a browser, and **npm** is a package manager used to download javascript packages(packages required for your project to run) built to run on Node. They come bundled together when you install **Node.js**.  

    You’ll need to have **Node >= 14.0.0** and **npm >= 5.6** on your machine and you can download Node.js and npm from https://nodejs.org.
    After downloading install **Node.js** and **npm** by opening the downloaded installer.  

    > Test that Node.js and npm were installed successfully by running the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.  

    Instead of **npm** we can also use **yarn** and you can download it from https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/.  
    > Teat yarn was installed successfully by running the command `yarn --version`.
    <br>

2. ### **Install the Git CLI :**
    The **Git CLI** is the command-line interface used for cloning and interacting with git repositories(e.g. projects on GitHub) even if you want to upload your project on **Github**.  

    Download the Git CLI from https://git-scm.com/downloads and then install the **Git CLI** by opening the downloaded installer.  

    > Test that the **Git CLI** was installed successfully by running the command `git --version`.  
    <br>

3. ### **A Code Editor :**
    A recommended code editor would be [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) .  
    You can also go for  
    - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
    - [ATOM](https://atom.io/)
    - [Brackets](https://brackets.io/)
    - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

## **How to Create React App**
<br>

**React** is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.  
- Now to create a **React App**, we first need to open a terminal in VS Code(or any editor you are using) then :
    - We can use the tool **npx** (if we want some packages to be included in our application, but we don’t want to download it then we can use npx ). npx gives us the ability to use the `create-react-app` package without having to first install it on our computer.
      
       Command to create React App using npx :  
        ```
        npx create-react-app my-react-app
        ```  
    - Command to create React App using npm :
      ```
      npm init react-app my-react-app
      ``` 
      *Above command is available in `npm` 6+.*  

    - Command to create React App using yarn :
      ```
      yarn create react-app my-react-app
      ```
      *Above command is available in `Yarn` 0.25+.*  
      <br>
- Once we have executed the above command, a folder named **"my-react-app"** will be created where we specified on our computer and all of the packages it requires will be automatically installed.  

- Now after creating the `React App` to test whether our app is working correctly or not, open **"my-react-app"** folder with VS Code then in VS Code go to view and open up your terminal then write the following command :  
    ```
    npm start
    ```  
    or  
    ```
    yarn start
    ```
 - A new browser tab will automatically open up on `localhost:3000` and right away, we can see the starting home page for our app (if our react app was successfully installed).
