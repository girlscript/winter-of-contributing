# Introducing to React Hooks

Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. React hooks works only inside of functional components not in the class base components.

# We will be learning about most common hooks useState and useEffect.

# No.1 useState

We call useState Hook inside a functional component to add some local state to it.useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later.If value changes it will automatically rerender the page.

**Note:** React preserves the state during component re-render.

# Let's understand useState Hook with a example -

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
const Example = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Equivalent class example

```javascript
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

**What is happening in class component example code -**
The state starts as { count: 0 }, and we increment state.count when the user clicks a button by calling this.setState(). We’ll use snippets from this class throughout the page.

**What is happening in functional component usestate hook -** It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it. This is why we write const [count, setCount] = useState(). This is similar to this.state.count and this.setState in a class, except you get them in a pair.
The only argument useState Hook accepts is initial state.In our example, we just want a number for how many times the user clicked, so pass 0 as initial state for our variable. (If we wanted to store two different values in state, we would call useState() twice.)

# No 2. useEffect

The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components:
Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of side effects. Whether or not you’re used to calling these operations “side effects” (or just “effects”), you’ve likely performed them in your components before. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified into a single API.

# Let's understand useEffect Hook with a example -

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Example with Classes

```javascript
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

**Explanation -**

useEffect() hook accepts 2 arguments:
useEffect(callback[, dependencies]);
callback is the function containing the side-effect logic. callback is executed right after changes were being pushed to DOM.
dependencies is an optional array of dependencies. useEffect() executes callback only if the dependencies have changed between renderings.

# Why should we use hooks in functional component over class component -

**Reusability -**
One benefit of React Hooks is that you can decouple unrelated logic code from lifecycle methods. For example, consider a component called “Updating Clock and Resize” that does just two things:

Updates a clock every second
Adds a listener to the resize event and displays the updated content

**Testability -**
A common testing pattern in React is to test container and presentational components separately. This works for unit tests. However, if one container is composed of several HOCs, you will be required to test the container and components together in order to do the integration tests, which is generally more cumbersome.

**Readability -**
Like most React apps at the time (prior to React 16.7), the Confluent UI was divided into two categories: containers and presentational components, as suggested by Dan Abramov. A container was typically composed with a variety of higher-order components (HOCs) to reuse the logic and inject data. The presentational components received the data and callbacks via props passed from the containers.

# When should i choose functional components with hooks and when to choose class component with default sideEffect -

In class components, the render method will be called, whenever the state of the components changes. On the other hand, the Functional components render the UI based on the props.

Whenever we have the use case with the State of the component and rendering the UI based on the Component State, use the Class Components

Class Components should be preferred whenever we have the requirement with the state of the component.

So,it is totally depends on you which one you want to use.
