<h1 align="center">Using Event Listeners in Components</h1>

## Introduction
You might be acquainted with listening to events in a standard Javascript programme. In a React app, doing the same event listening could be a little more complicated. "Where do I add the event listener?" or "When and how do I cancel an event?" are questions you could have. These questions will be answered in this documentation.

<p>&nbsp</p>

## Adding an *Event Listener*

<p>&nbsp</p>

![Add-event-listener](https://c.tenor.com/ADEbOuubJIUAAAAC/doesnt-add-up-the-hangover.gif)

<p>&nbsp</p>

You can create an event listener in a React app by using the `window.addEventListener` method, just like you would in a vanilla Javascript app:

```js
window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
  // ...
});
```

The line of code above demonstrates how to add a `keydown` event listener to the window. The most difficult aspect of this snippet is deciding where to put it. React is a system built on the concept of components. Because all of your pages are merely components, adding an event listener will have to take place inside of one of them. Here's an example of a component where a `keydown` listener may be useful:

```js
import React from 'react';

const App = (props) => {
  window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    // ...
  });
  return (
    <div className='container'>
      <h1>Welcome to the Keydown Listening Component</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

There are a couple of problems with the code above.

    1. You only want the event listener added when the component finishes rendering.

    2. You need to remove the event listener when the component is unmounted.

To solve the first issue you will need to use the *useEffect* hook. From the `React.useEffect` [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect):

> The function passed to `useEffect` will run after the render is committed to the screen.

```js
const App = (props) => {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
      // ...
    });
  });

  return (
    <div className='container'>
      <h1>Welcome to the Keydown Listening Component</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The `addEventListener` is now called at the proper moment, but there is still a problem: the way it is designed currently, every time a component changes, a new listener is added. This is due to the fact that you must specify the `useEffect` hook to only execute when the component renders for the first time. You may accomplish this by passing an empty dependency array as the second parameter to `useEffect`:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
      // ...
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className='container'>
      <h1>Welcome to the Keydown Listening Component</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

When you pass that dependency array to the hook, it informs it to only run the callback function if one of the dependencies changes. The `useEffect` hook will only execute once if you provide it an empty array. Because you don't want to create a duplicate event listener, you'd want this behaviour in this situation.

## Event listeners on particular Components

Using React elements to handle events is quite similar to using DOM elements. There are various variations in syntax:

- React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.

- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

For example, the HTML:

```js
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

is slightly different in React:


```js
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

Another distinction is that with React, you cannot return `false` to disable default behaviour. You must specifically call `preventDefault`. To avoid the normal form behaviour of submitting, for example, you may use simple HTML and write:

```js
<form onsubmit="console.log('You clicked submit.'); return false">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

In React, this could instead be:

```js
function Form() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('You clicked submit.');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

`e` is a synthetic event in this case. You don't have to worry about cross-browser compatibility because React specifies these synthetic events according to the [W3C protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/). React events aren't the same as native events in that they don't operate in the same way. For additional information, see the [SyntheticEvent](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html) reference guide.

When utilising React, you usually don't need to use `addEventListener` after a DOM element has been built to add listeners. Instead, when the element is first displayed, just supply a listener.


- **Note:** *There are so many articles about how to handle events in React components. This is because of issues with `this`. Maintaining the proper context of `this` in component functions requires either using the `bind` method or arrow functions. This is because of the very nature of inline events. Because the event is defined on a DOM node, it has no direct reference to the parent component.*

<p>&nbsp</p>

<strong><p align="center" >We will take the example of handleEvent.</p></strong>

## handleEvent

According to [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener):


> The [EventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener) method `handleEvent()` is called by the [*user agent*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/user_agent) when an event is sent to the `EventListener`, in order to handle events that occur on an observed [EventTarget](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget).


This implies that if an event listener is provided anything with a handleEvent function, it will be utilised. To handle the events, we instinctively provide callbacks to event listeners. You may also supply an object that has a handleEvent method:


```js
const eventObj = {
  handleEvent(e) {
    alert(`Hello, there! You clicked on a ${e.target.nodeName}`)
  }
}
const btn = document.querySelector('button')
btn.addEventListener('click', eventObj)
```

Notice how the first argument of the `handleEvent` function gives us access to the event in the preceding example. We could construct an object containing methods for handling a component's state using this approach. In reality, we'll use a React component to do this.

<p>&nbsp</p>

### **React Component + ref + handleEvent**

We'll now make a React counter with two buttons that can be used to increase and decrease its value. In a React component, we'll use the `handleEvent` protocol to do this. When you're finished, it'll look like this:

<p>&nbsp</p>

![handleEvent](https://miro.medium.com/max/264/1*RBd7gh6WvtwlXc1gzgLtvg.png)

<p>&nbsp</p>

We need an element to register an event listener on before we can use `handleEvent` with a React component, like we did in the previous basic example. This will necessitate the use of `ref` and `componentDidMount`. We'll start with a value of 0 because this is a counter. We'll also make a `ref` named "element."


```js
class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {num: 0}
    this.element = React.createRef()
  }
}
```

Next we’ll define the structure of the counter in the component’s render function. Notice that we are not using any inline events. We set our `ref` value on the root element of the component, the `div` tag, `withref={this.element}`:


```js
class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {num: 0}
    this.element = React.createRef()
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div ref={this.element}>
        <button className='increase'>+</button>
        <label>{this.state.num}</label>
        <button className="decrease">-</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

With `this.element`, we can now refer to the component's base element. This will be accomplished in the `componentDidMount` lifecycle hook. To register a click event, we'll utilise the element reference. Instead of specifying a callback, we'll use the `this` keyword to pass in the class itself as the object. Take a look at the `componentDidMount` lifecycle hook:


```js
class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {num: 0}
    this.element = React.createRef()
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div ref={this.element}>
        <button className='increase'>+</button>
        <label>{this.state.num}</label>
        <button className="decrease">-</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.element.current.addEventListener('click', this)
  }
}
```

When the user clicks on something inside the component, the browser will look for a `handleEvent` function in the class. As a result, we'll need to get one for our class. The event will be the only parameter passed to that method.

Because our component has two buttons, we can utilise their classes to determine which one was clicked by the user. If the class `rises`, the counter state rises, and if the class `falls`, the counter state falls. We'll make one way for this:


```js
updateCounter(value) {
  this.setState(prevState => {
    prevState.num += value
    return prevState
  })
}
```

We can them pass a positive or negative value to update the component’s state. The handleEvent method will look like this:


```js
handleEvent(e) {
  e.target.className === 'increase' && this.updateCounter(+1)
  e.target.className === 'decrease' && this.updateCounter(-1)
}
```

And here’s the complete component:


```js
class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {num: 0}
    this.element = React.createRef()
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div ref={this.element}>
        <button className='increase'>+</button>
        <label>{this.state.num}</label>
        <button className="decrease">-</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.element.current.addEventListener('click', this)
  }
  handleEvent(e) {
    e.target.className === 'increase' && this.updateCounter(+1)
    e.target.className === 'decrease' && this.updateCounter(-1)
  }
  updateCounter(value) {
    this.setState(prevState => {
      prevState.num += value
      return prevState
    })
  }
}  
ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, document.querySelector('article'))
```

This approach moves events away from the HTML of the component and into JavaScript. There's no need to sift through markup looking for inline events. There's also no need to be concerned with the timeline of events. The component instance will always be the context. This is also highly memory efficient, because memory leaks from closures are avoided because there are no callbacks. Removing the event is a piece of cake. We just send in the `this` component as follows:


```js
this.element.current.removeEventListener('click', this)
```

And it'll look something like this when you run it:

## Removing an Event Listener

You'll need to know how to delete the event listener if the component is no longer mounted now that you've added it to your component. `window.removeEventListener` is the function for deleting an event listener.

```js
window.removeEventListener('keydown', handlekeyDown);
```

You'll note that the second parameter to `removeEventListener` is a variable rather than an anonymous function. Because you might potentially have several `keydown` event listeners running at the same time, this is required for determining which event listener to delete.

When the component unmounts, all you have to do now is use `removeEventListener`, but how do you accomplish that in a functional component? Although there is no `componentDidUnmount` lifecycle method, the `useEffect` hook provides a callback function with an optional `return` value. When the component unmounts, you can return a function to the `useEffect` callback, and that function will be executed. After successfully deleting an event listener, your code should look like this:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const handleKeyDown = (event) => {
    console.log('A key was pressed', event.keyCode);
  };

  React.useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);

    // cleanup this component
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className='container'>
      <h1>Welcome to the Keydown Listening Component</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```
