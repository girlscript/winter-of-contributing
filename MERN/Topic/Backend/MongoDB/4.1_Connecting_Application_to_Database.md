# Connecting an Application to a Local Database

MongoDB is undoubtedly one of the most popular No-SQL database choices used by the developers today.  
To connect our application i.e. a Node.js App with a local database on our system, we can use Mongoose.

<p>&nbsp</p>

## 1. Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.  
Basically, it is a package that we use to interact (query, update, manipulate) with our MongoDB database in our Node.js app.

### **Prerequisites**
Before we move on, you'll need the following - 
1. Node.js installed on your machine.
2. MongoDB installed on your machine.

<p>&nbsp</p>

## 2. STEPS required to make a connection

### **STEP 1 - Installing some Dependencies:**
Install the dependencies Mongoose and Nodemon using the following command - 

    npm install --save mongoose 

If you are using yarn then you must use this command - 

    yard add mongoose 

<p>&nbsp</p>

### **STEP 2 - Importing the package into our project:**
We will import the mongoose package into our project by requiring it using the following code - 

```js
    const mongoose = require("mongoose");
```

<p>&nbsp</p>

### **STEP 3 - Including the URL of the database:**
When you use Mongoose, the connection URL should include the local database you are connecting to.

```js
    const url = "mongodb://localhost:27017/{database_name}";
```

By default, MongoDB listens for connections from clients on port 27017.

<p>&nbsp</p>

### **STEP 4 - Setting up the connection:**
The local database is connected to the node.js app using the following code - 

```js
    mongoose.connect(url, {useNewUrlParser: true})
```

We pass the `useNewUrlParser: true` to avoid the Deprecation Warning.

<p>&nbsp</p>

### **STEP 5 - Checking the Connection:**
Here's how we can check whether the connection has been established or not.

```js
    mongoose.connect(url, {useNewUrlParser: true}, (error)=>{
        if(!error)
            {
                console.log("Successful Connection");
            }
        else
            {
                console.log("Error");
            }
    });
```

<p>&nbsp</p>

### **STEP 6 - Starting and Checking if MongoDB is running:**
You can start the MongoDB on your computer using the following commnad - 

    mongod
    
Keep the mongod window running when you want to work with your local MongoDB. MongoDB stops when you close the window.

To check whether the MongoDB is running or not we use the command -

    service mongod status
