# 1. What is Mongoose?
Mongoose is a MongoDB Object database Modelling library that is used to translate the code and its representation from MongoDB to the Node.js server. Mongoose gives a schema-based solution to model your application data. Mongoose module provides several functions so as to control the documents of the collection of the MongoDB database. It consists of built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and many more. The problem that Mongoose aims to unravel is allowing developers to enforce a particular schema at the application layer. 

MongoDB uses schema to model the data. The schema describes the properties that the application will manipulate. These attributes include the following: 
- Data type (e.g. String, Number, etc.).
- Whether it is mandatory or optional.
- Is its value unique, which means that the database may only contain one document with that value in that property.

The schema generates a model, which defines the document on which the application will operate. A model, in more technical terms, is a class that defines a document with the properties and behaviors specified in our schema. All database operations performed on a document with Mongoose must include a model reference.
A simple schema definition can be as given:
```
var userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  firstname: String,
  lastname: String,
  createdOn: Date
});
```
The difference in the code in MongoDB and Mongoose is depicted below:

# 2. What is the need for Mongoose?
Mongoose allows to define a schema for the data. This helps to interact with the MongoDB data in a structured way. It helps with MongoDB operations, and removes some levels of complexity from the nested callbacks. Mongoose returns the data as a JSON object to use directly, rather than the JSON string returned by MongoDB.
The top reasons are as follows:
- Schemas - MongoDB is a NoSQL database with a denormalized schema. As documents have varying sets of fields with different data types, it is inherently schema-less. While this provides flexibility to the data model as it evolves over time, it can be difficult to deal with if one is ffrom a SQL background. Mongoose creates a schema for the data models, ensuring that the documents have a consistent structure and use pre-defined data types. 
- Validations - Validation for schema definitions is built into Mongoose. This saves one from attempting to create a bunch of validation code that would otherwise have to be written with the MongoDB driver. Mongoose provides out-of-the-box validations for the collections by simply including things like required:true in the schema definitions (including data types).
- Instance Methods - Mongoose offers pre and post save operations for data models. This makes it far easier to define hooks and custom functionality based on successful reads/writes, for instance. You can also define custom methods that operate on a specific instance (or document). While the native MongoDB driver provides similar functionality, Mongoose makes it easier to define and structure such methods within your schema definition. 
- Return Results - Mongoose makes it so much easier to return updated documents or query results. Update queries are an excellent example. Unlike the native driver, which returns an object with a success flag and the number of documents modified, Mongoose returns the updated object itself, allowing one to easily manage the results.

# 3. How to install Mongoose?
In order to install mongoose one can use npm (node package manager).

### 3.1 Use command in Command Prompt
1. Use the command in the desired folder.
```
npm install mongoose
```
### 3.2 Install in custom location
1. Create a package.json in the required folder and place the below code.
```
{
"name" : "MyMongoose",
"dependencies" : {
"express" : "~4.8.8",
"morgan": "~1.3.0",
"compression": "~1.0.11",
"body-parser": "~1.8.0",
"method-override": "~2.2.0",
"mongodb": "~2.1",
"mongoose": "~3.8.15"
}
}
```
2. Use the below command from Command Prompt where the package.json exists.
```
npm install
```
or
```
npm update
```
3. A folder named 'node_modules' will be created with the above dependencies and mongoose would have been installed.
