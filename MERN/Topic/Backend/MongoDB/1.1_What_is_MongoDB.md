# What is MongoDB?

<p>MongoDB is a NoSQL database management system that is free and open source. Traditional relational databases are replaced by NoSQL databases. Working with massive sets of distributed data is a breeze with NoSQL databases. MongoDB is a software tool that can store and retrieve document-oriented data.

MongoDB can handle a multitude of different data types. It's one of a number of non - relational database systems that arose in the mid-2000s under the NoSQL banner, usually for use in big data applications and other processing operations involving data that doesn't fit well in a conventional relational paradigm. MongoDB's design is made up of collections and documents rather than tables and rows, like in relational databases.

Mongo DB's ad-hoc queries, indexing, load balancing, aggregation, server-side JavaScript execution, and other features can be availed by industries and business owners. <br /><br /></p>

# Why MongoDB?

<p>MongoDB, like other NoSQL databases, does not need preset schemas. It can store any type of information. This allows users to create any amount of fields in a document, allowing MongoDB databases scale more easily than relational databases.

The fact that documents map to native data types in a variety of programming languages is one of the benefits of using them. Embedded documents also reduce the need for database joins, which can save money.

MongoDB's horizontal scalability is a key feature that makes it a good choice for enterprises with big data applications. Furthermore, sharding enables the database to share data across a group of servers. Newer MongoDB versions additionally permit the formation of data zones based on a shard key.

MongoDB supports a variety of storage engines and provides pluggable storage engine APIs that allow third-party developers to create their own MongoDB storage engines.

The database management system also includes built-in aggregation capabilities, allowing users to run MapReduce code directly on the database rather than on Hadoop. MongoDB also comes with its own file system, GridFS, which is similar to Hadoop's Distributed File System (HDFS). The file system is primarily used to store files larger than BSON's 16 MB per document size restriction. MongoDB can be used instead of Hadoop because of these similarities, though it does integrate with Hadoop, Spark, and other data processing frameworks.<br /><br /></p>

# Introduction to MongoDB

<p>MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database that is the most popular NoSQL database. The phrase ‘NoSQL' stands for ‘non-relational database.' It indicates that MongoDB isn't built on the table-like structure of relational databases, but instead uses a completely different technique for data store and retrieval. BSON is the name of the storage format ( similar to JSON format).

Data is stored in a tabular manner in SQL databases. This information is kept in a preset data schema that isn't very flexible for today's fast-growing real-world applications. Modern applications are more social, interactive, and networked than ever before. Applications are storing an increasing amount of data and accessing it at a faster rate.

Because they are not horizontally scalable, relational database management systems (RDBMS) are not the best choice for dealing with large amounts of data. The database will encounter a scaling limit if it is run on a single server. NoSQL databases are more scalable and perform better than SQL databases. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that expands when more servers are added, while also increasing efficiency thanks to its flexible document model.</p><br />

### **<u>The Main MongoDB Features :</u>**<br /><br />

- <strong>Document Oriented</strong> : <br />
MongoDB maintains the primary subject in the fewest amount of documents possible, rather than dividing it up into various relational structures as RDBMS does. For example, it keeps all of a computer's information in an one document called Computer, rather than in separate relational structures like CPU, RAM, and Hard disk.<br /><br />

- <strong>Scalability</strong> : <br />
Sharding allows MongoDB to scale horizontally (distributing data across numerous servers). The shard key is used to partition data into data pieces, which are then uniformly dispersed across shards that span several physical servers. A running database can also be expanded by adding new machines.<br /><br />

- <strong>Indexing</strong> : <br />
Without indexing, a database would have to sift through every document in a collection to find those that fit the query, which would be time consuming. As a result, indexing is required for efficient searching, and MongoDB employs it to analyze large volumes of data in a short amount of time.<br /><br />

- <strong>Replication and High Availability</strong> : <br />
With numerous copies of data on separate servers, MongoDB improves data availability. It protects the database against hardware failures by providing redundancy. If one server goes down, the data can be simply accessed from other active servers that have the same data.<br /><br />

- <strong>Aggregation</strong> : <br />
Data records are processed by aggregation processes, which then produce the computed results. It's analogous to SQL's GROUPBY clause. Sum, average, min, max, and other aggregating expressions are a few examples.<br /><br />
