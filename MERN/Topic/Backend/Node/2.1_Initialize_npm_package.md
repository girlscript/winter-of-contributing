# How to Initialize npm package
Before getting to how to iniatialze a NPM package,

## What is NPM?
So, NPM stands for Node Package Manager for Javascript.

# Why do we need it?
1)In our projects we need to use external dependencies, we can write everything from scratch but an efficient way will be to create a module  and to push it to a repository from where anywhere can use it.

So, here comes the concept of NPM, it has millions of packages available, which can be downloaded withoit having to go through whole process of creating an API from scratch yourself.

2)As the size of our project increases, it becomes difficult to handle all these dependencies and their versions manually, which becomes easier with npm.

# How do we initialize a npm package?
To initialize an NPM package into our NodeJs project, we simply have to-

1)Open our terminal.

2)Navigate to the working project directory.

3)Run the command - 

        npm init
       
which basically does is create a package.json file inside our project directory.

4)Answer the questionairre in the command prompt itself- which includes name, version, description, main, test command, git repository, keywords, author, and license which you can also leave to default for the time.

# package.json file
After the command has been executed, a package.json file is created which has the important metadata aboit your project and the installed dependencies with their versions.
It will also be used for definign the run scripts which will used by default.

A sample package.json file will look like this-
