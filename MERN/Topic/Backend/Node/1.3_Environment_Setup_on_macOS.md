# **Installing Node.js and npm on Mac**

## **Steps to download Node.js and npm on MacOS :**  
   The first thing you should do is to check if you have a version of Node.js and npm already installed in your mac. To do that:  
   - Open your terminal :
     - Command to check the version of Node.js : 
       ```
       node -v
       ```  
     - Command to check the version of npm :
       ```
       npm -v
       ```   
  - If you do have **Node.js** and **npm** installed, it will output the version.  

    - Update to the latest version of Node.js and npm using `npm i -g npm`. If you get a bunch of `checkPermissions` warnings, you should run the command as the superuser like this: `sudo npm i -g npm`.  

    - If you are on the latest version then you are all set to use.

  - If you do not have **Node.js** and **npm** installed, it will output something like `-bash: node: command not found`.  

      - Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/). You'll see download links for MacOS.

      - When installation is complete, open the Terminal and enter `node -v` and `npm -v` to check if they are installed on your computer or not.  
      If a version was output, then your installation was successfull.
