## JSON 
- It is a javascript object notation format very similar to xml.
- Commonly used for APIs and Configs.
- Lightweight and easy to read/write as compared to other formats like xml.
- Integrates very nicely with almost all languages.


### JSON types:

- String   eg:"Hello"
- Numbers  eg:10,-3,1.2e10
- Boolean  eg:true,false
- null  eg:null
- Array  eg:[1,2,3],["hello","john"]
- Object  eg:{"key":"value"},{"age":30}


### How to create a JSON file:

- Name anything you want,just give it an extension of json.Eg:`companies.json`.
- Most of the time we have arrays,objects or array of objects as our data in our JSON file.

Here,we are creating a `user.json` file for demonstrating how to enter a data in .json files,we can use it in any other file by referncing to it for data or importing it.

```
{
"name":"john",
"age":40,
"hobbies":["coding","gymming"],
"friends":[
{
"name:"jo",
"favouritecolor":"blue",
"programmer":true
}]
}
```



Now,we design an array of objects as companies,when we console.log it,we get the following output:

```
[
    {
        "name":"Company1",
        "noOfEmployees":100000,
        "ceo":"John",
        "ratings":4.4
    },
    {
        "name":"Company2",
        "noOfEmployees":5,
        "ceo":"Rohan",
        "ratings":3.3
    }
]
```

### Now the point to be noted here is that when we are actually using json,when  we fetch/import data,it is mostly in the form of a  string rather than a javascript object.(Unlike here,where we are getting an object returned at console).
So,to emulate lets take the example where we make our comapny array as a string by wrapping it under backticks,and then console logging it.

In the console,we can see that it returns a string instead of a javascript object which we actually want.

```
`[
    {
        "name":"Company1",
        "noOfEmployees":100000,
        "ceo":"John",
        "ratings":4.4
    },
    {
        "name":"Company2",
        "noOfEmployees":5,
        "ceo":"Rohan",
        "ratings":3.3
    }
]`
```

###  To convert this *JSON string* into a *javascript object*,we use `JSON.parse` for the same.

```
    let companies=
`[
    {
        "name":"Company1",
        "noOfEmployees":100000,
        "ceo":"John",
        "ratings":4.4
    },
    {
        "name":"Company2",
        "noOfEmployees":5,
        "ceo":"Rohan",
        "ratings":3.3
    }
]`


console.log(JSON.parse(companies));
```

#### For outputting a single object member,we run the following code,

```
   let companies=
`[
    {
        "name":"Company1",
        "noOfEmployees":100000,
        "ceo":"John",
        "ratings":4.4
    },
    {
        "name":"Company2",
        "noOfEmployees":5,
        "ceo":"Rohan",
        "ratings":3.3
    }
]`


console.log(JSON.parse(companies)[0].name);
```
