# **Installing Node.js and npm on Windows**

## **Steps to download Node.js and npm on Windows :**

The first thing you should do is to check if you have a version of Node.js and npm already installed in your operating system. To do that: 

   - Open your Command Prompt :
     - Command to check the version of Node.js : 
       
       ```js
       node -v
       ```  
     
     - Command to check the version of npm :
       
       ```js
       npm -v
       ```

  - If you do have **Node.js** and **npm** installed, it will output the version.
  
    - Update to the latest version of Node.js and npm using 
    
    ```js 
    npm i -g npm
    ```
    If you get a bunch of `checkPermissions` warnings, you should run the command as the superuser like this:
    
    ```js
    sudo npm i -g npm
    ```  

    - If you are on the latest version then you are all set to use.

- If you do not have **Node.js** and **npm** installed, it will output something like:

    ```js
    node -v
    'node' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
    operable program or batch file.
    ```

    - Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/). You'll see download links for Windows.

    - Click `Next` and go through the entire installation process.

    - When installation is complete, open the Command Prompt and enter `node -v` and `npm -v` to check if they are installed on your computer or not.

        ```js
        node -v
        v16.5.0
        ```
        ```js
        npm -v
        7.24.1
        ```

        If a version similar to the above format appeared as the output, then your installation was successful.
