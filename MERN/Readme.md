    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "your-commit-message" -m "your-commit-description"
    ```

7. Push your local work to your remote URL (Forked Repo)

   ```bash
   $ git push origin <Sample-Branch>
   ```

8. Create Pull Request.

## Project Structure üìÅ
1. For the naming of directories, we use [Start Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#:~:text=each%20word%20capitalized%29-,%22The%20Quick%20Brown%20Fox%20Jumps%20Over%20The%20Lazy%20Dog%22,-Start%20case%20or),
   which is the unarguable standard to be enforced in the event
   repository. We shall stick to the same.
2. The repository structure will be something like this:
Branch structure: 

      - MERN
        ```css
  
        |- MERN  
        |     |- Topic
        |     |    |- FRONTEND
        |     |    |      |- React
        |     |    |      |- Readme.md 
        |     |    |      
        |     |    |- BACKEND 
        |     |    |      |- Node
        |     |    |      |- Express
        |     |    |      |- MongoDB 
        |     |    |      |- Readme.md 
        |     |    |                    
        |     |    |- Projects 
        |     |           |- 1. 
        |     |           |- 2. 
        |     |           |- Readme.md 
        |     |    
        |     |- Readme.md
        |     |- Contributing.md 

        ```

      - Inside FRONTEND

        ```css
        |- React
        |     |- 1.1_Introduction_to_React(D).md  # Documentation
        |     |- 2.1_Introduction_to_React(V).md  # Video
        |     |- 3.
        |     |- Readme.md
        
                
        ```
            

3. For the topic folders, we will follow the following naming convention:
   ```
   {Serial Number}_Title_In_Pascal_Snake_Case.md
   ```
   For example, for the following topic:

   - Serial number: 2
   - Topic name: Getting started with MERN

   We will have the following name for the folder:
   ```
   2_Getting_Started_With_MERN.md
   ```

## Issues üáßüá∂
You may raise relevant issues within the repository, keeping
the following points in mind:
- The title of the issue must have the `MERN_React: <Serial no.>` prefix.
  
  E.g, `MERN_React: 2.1 JSX in React`.
- The issue must mention which folder location should be
  created/used.
  
  E.g, `MERN>MERN/Topic/Frontend/React/`.
- A well-defined (not necessarily long) description of the
  topic in focus must be provided.

  E.g, `A tutorial on using JSX in React`.
- Including graphics and references is encouraged.

## Pull Requests üîº
You may create PRs for existing issues within the repository, keeping
the following points in mind:
- The title for the PR should be same as the Issue, for e.g if you are working on issue  `MERN_React: 2.1 JSX in React`, then the PR title will go same as `MERN_React: 2.1 JSX in React`

- Provide a description about your PR.
  
- The PR must mention which issue(s) is/are being resolved, with
  the `resolves`, `closes`, or `fixes` keyword (case-insensitive) preceding the
  issue number prefixed with a `#`.

  E.g, Assuming the issue number is 3, any of the following works:
  - `Resolves #3`
  - `Closes #3`
  - `Fixes #3`
- A well-defined (not necessarily long) description of the
  updates made must be provided.
