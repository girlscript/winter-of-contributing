# Recursive Implementation of Tower of Hanoi Problem.


## What is Tower of Hanoi Problem ?

![Tower of Hanoi](https://xp.io/storage/10gu6TNG.png)

Here in the diagram there are 3 towers given and in one of the tower there are some number of disks kept (there can be any number of disks).

Here the problem is we have to kept all the disks from tower A to tower C with the help of tower But. 
#### Note:- But here the condition is we have to move one disk at a time and we have to tranfer such that no larger disk is to be kept over a smaller disk.

### It seems to be a unsolvable problem .

_But it can be solved by using Recursion_ !!
