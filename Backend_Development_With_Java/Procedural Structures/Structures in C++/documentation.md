# Structure in C++

## Introduction

A structure type is a user-defined composite type. It is composed of fields or members that can have different types.

- In C++, a structure is the same as a class except that its members are public by default.

- In C, you must explicitly use the struct keyword to declare a structure. In C++, you do not need to use the struct keyword after the type has been defined.

- You have the option of declaring variables when the structure type is defined by placing one or more comma-separated variable names between the closing brace and the semicolon.

Structure variables can be initialized. The initialization for each variable must be enclosed in braces.

## General Syntax

```
[template-spec] struct [ms-decl-spec] [tag [: base-list ]]
{
   member-list
} [declarators];
[struct] tag declarators;
```

If you find this syntax a bit complicated, don't worry guys.
