# STACKS
Stack is a linear data structure on which operations are performed in a particular order.The order is called **LIFO** i.e. LAST IN FIRST OUT. What we mean by LIFO is that the element which was inserted at last in the stack will be the first element to come out of the stack.We can relate it to real life example like stack of books in cupboard.The book that we placed initially will be the last book that we can take out.Sometimes this principle is also known as **FILO** i.e. First in Last Out.

Primarily four operations need to be performed on stack:

- push(element)<br>
Inserting the particular element in the Stack.
- pop()<br>
Delete the topmost element of stack.
- top()<br>
Return the topmost element of stack without deleting it.
- isEmpty()<br>
Return true if stack is empty otherwise false.<br><br>
Stacks can be implemented using arrays as well as linked list.
