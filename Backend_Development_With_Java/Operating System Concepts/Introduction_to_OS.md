# **Introduction to Operating System**
---
*  Operating system is a software that takes control of your machine as soon it is switched on.
* It acts as an interface between user and hardware.

How does it act as an interface between user and hardware? <br>
Suppose there is no operating system and we want to type something in MS WORD.
 * Then we have to tell the computer manually that we want to type something.
 * Whatever we are writing in a Word document has to be displayed on the screen for that we have to tell the hardware to display it on the screen.
 * After writing  we have to save the document for that also we have to tell the hardware where to save, how much memory will be needed etc.<br>

So, for every task, we have to explicitly tell the hardware what we want to do in form of codes. We have to write source code for that. Therefore, it will be a very tedious task. To overcome this situation we use an operating system. The operating system resides between user and hardware and acts as an interface between user and hardware. All the minute task which we had to do manually in absence of operating system is now done by the operating system.

Examples of Operating System:<br>
* Desktop- Windows, Linux, MacOS etc</li>
* Mobile- Android , IOS etc</li>

Types of Operating System :-
* Batch Operating System</li>
* Time Sharing Operating System</li>
* Distributed OperatingSystem</li>
* Network Operating System</li>
* Real time OperatingSystem</li>
* Multi Programming / Processing /Tasking Operating System etc.</li>


Functions of Operating System:-<br>
* It acts as an interface between User and Hardware:- all the communication done between user and hardware takes place through Operating System.

* Resource Management:- We have limited resources in our machine and multiple processes are running like chrome, word processor, etc. Therefore we need a manager to decide which process should be using the CPU first according to the priorities of the process. These all things are decided by the operating system.

* Protection:- Since we have multiple applications running on a system, we have to ensure that one application does not impact other applications and the system. Operating System acts as a manager and ensures that our system is safe from any malware.


Do we always need  a manager ?<br>
* There might be situations where we don't need a system software like an operating system to manage everything. For example simple chips. We have a very simple processor for managing the lift i.e taking the control to move it up and down, in that situation we do not need an operating system to run this simple application on a simple processor. Therefore we can say that we need an operating system where things are complex and we need a manager to manage those things.

### Commonalities in an operating system

* Multiprogramming : <br>
 A single user cannot keep either the CPU or I/O device busy at all the time. This makes the system less efficient. Multiprogramming is a feature that increases CPU utilization by organizing jobs in such a way so that the CPU always has one task to execute.
* Multitasking :<br>In multitasking, multiple tasks can be done at the same time For example, we can listen to songs and can browse chrome at the same time .
 The task here refers to a process. We can open multiple processes at the same time because in multitasking all the processes can co-exist in memory.
