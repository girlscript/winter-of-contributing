# **Introduction to SQL,DBMA AND RDMS**

### ***Introduction to SQL***

SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**. 

It is used for storing and managing data in relational database management system (RDMS).
It is a standard Database language. It enables a user to create, read, update and delete relational databases and tables.

* All the RDBMS like MySQL, Informix, Oracle, MS Access and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.

* SQL allows users to query the database in a number of ways, using English-like statements

*  All databases that are not relational (or do not use fixed structure tables to store data) and therefore do not use SQL, are called NoSQL databases. Examples of NoSQL are MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra, etc.

### ***Introduction to DBMS***

DBMS stands for **Database Management System**.

Database management system is software that is used to manage the database.
Database is a collection of inter-related data which helps in efficient **retrieval, insertion and deletion** of data from database and organizes the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports etc.


* Database management system is a software which is used to manage the database. For example: MySQL, Oracle, etc are a very popular commercial database which is used in different applications.

* DBMS provides an interface to perform various operations like **database creation, storing data in it, updating data, **creating a table in the database and a lot more.

* It provides protection and security to the database. In the case of multiple users, it also maintains data consistency.

* Examples of DBMS are **file systems, xml** etc.

### ***Introduction to RDBMS***

RDBMS stands for **Relational Database Management System**.

Relational Database is a database system that stores and retrieves data in a **tabular format** organized in the form of rows and columns.

***It is a smaller subset of DBMS.***

* Relational DBMS owes its foundation to the fact that the values of each table are related to others. It has the capability to handle larger magnitudes of data and simulate queries easily.

* RDBMS supports distributed database.

* RDBMS defines the integrity constraint for the purpose of ACID (Atomocity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) property.

* Example of RDBMS are mysql, postgre, sql server, oracle etc.
