# Data Structures and Algorithms


Hey everyone! 👋 [GirlScript Winter of Contributing](https://gwoc.girlscript.tech/) is a three-month newly established initiative by GirlScript Foundation to be conducted during winters. Over the course of the program, participants can contribute to a variety of themes under the guidance of an expert facilitator. This is the DSA branch for contribution under Girlscript Winter Of Contributing. All GWOC Contributors and Mentors are welcome to contribute to DSA.

# Introduction
Data Structures are the main part of many computer science algorithms as they enable the programmers to handle the data in an efficient way. Data Structures are widely used in almost every aspect of Computer Science i.e. Operating System, Compiler Design, Artifical intelligence, Graphics and many more.

  In this project, we're creating a multilingual content repository intended to contain tutorials, code walkthroughs, explanatory articles, etc pertaining to the DSA topics in the form of documentation, audio and video.
