# Data Structures and Algorithms


Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ [GirlScript Winter of Contributing](https://gwoc.girlscript.tech/) is a three-month newly established initiative by GirlScript Foundation to be conducted during winters. GWOC encourages individuals to share their knowledge and ideas to develop technical skills and gain valuable experience in the field of tech education. Over the course of the program, participants can contribute to a variety of themes under the guidance of an expert facilitator.

This is the DSA branch for contribution under Girlscript Winter Of Contributing. All the GWOC Contributors and Mentors are welcome!

## Introduction
Data Structures are the main part of many computer science algorithms as they enable the programmers to handle the data in an efficient way. Data Structures are widely used in almost every aspect of Computer Science i.e. Operating System, Compiler Design, Artifical intelligence, Graphics and many more.

  In this project, we're creating a multilingual content repository intended to contain tutorials, code walkthroughs, explanatory articles, etc pertaining to the DSA topics in the form of documentation, audio and video.

## Contribution Guidelines :gear:
Please refer to the **[DSA Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/girlscript/winter-of-contributing/blob/DSA/DSA/CONTRIBUTING.md)** within the same folder for all the submission guidelines. It contains the documentation process to assist you. Please go through it before creating issues/PRs.
  
  **Important Note: Kindly create issues/PRs only according to the Week Agenda present above. Your issues/PRs will be closed if you take up any topic outside the specific week's mentioned topic. Example: For Week 1, the week agenda includes Array and Analysis of Algorithms so you may create issues/PRs pertaining to only these topics.**
