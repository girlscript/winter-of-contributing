Greedy algorithm solves a problem by making decisions based on the best choice possible at that instance. We only think about the present scenario, without considering the future. Many optimization problems can be solved using a greedy approach. However, the greedy solution might not be the global optimal solution for many problems. But at the same time, it can be very close to the optimal solution.

#### When can greedy algorithm be used? 

1. The problems that have subparts to it, and those sub parts have at least one optimal solution each, which further leads to a globally optimal solution.

2. Once the choices are made that seem locally optimal at that instance, we can only move forward from there. There is no chance of moving backwards and changing our decisions.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages


The advantage of greedy algorithm is that it is very easy to find a locally optimal solution and computing the time and space complexity for the same. However, it is quite tough to prove why our greedy solution is an optimal one.

#### Examples
Few examples of algorithms that use the greedy approach to find the optimal solution are :- 
1. Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest route from a point
2. Kruskal’s minimum spanning tree
3. Knapsack problem
4. Job scheduling
