**What is Graph Coloring problem?**

 Graph Coloring problem basically depends on three rules
 
 1.Every node in Graph should be colored.
 
 2.While coloring nodes make sure that no two adjacent nodes of Graph should be colored with same Color.
 
 3.The  Chromatic number of graph should be minimum.
 
 **Chromatic number** : The minimum number of colors required to color the graph is known as Chromatic number.
 
 **Graph Coloring Algorithm** : 
 
 By using minimum number of colors to color the  entire graph ,such that no two adjacent nodes are colored with same color is explained in Graph Colored Problem
 
 **Examples** : 
 
 **Chromatic number of** 
 
 1.Traingle - 3
 
 2.Square - 2
