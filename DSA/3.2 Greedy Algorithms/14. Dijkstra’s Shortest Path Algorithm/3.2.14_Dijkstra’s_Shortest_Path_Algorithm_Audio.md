**What is Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm?**

Dijkstra's algorithm is the iterative algorithmic process to provide us with the shortest path from one specific starting node to all other nodes of a graph.

This algorithm makes use of weights of edges for finding the path that minimizes the total distance (weight) among the source node and all other nodes.

This algorithm is also known as *Single source shortest path algorithm.*
