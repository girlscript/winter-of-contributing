You are given a number n, representing the number of stairs in a staircase.

You are on the 0th step and are required to climb to the top.

You are given n numbers, where ith element's value represents - till how far from the step you could jump to in a single move. Y4. 

You are required to print the number of minimum moves in which you can reach the top of the staircase.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach : (DP) </b></i>

Let's understand this first.

If we have:

x moves to go from a to D

y moves to go from b to D

z moves to go from c to D


Then for going from S to D the path with the minimum move will be min(x, y, z) + 1.

We will again make it into 3 states:

<i><b>Storage and Meaning: </b></i>

This time also we will make an integer array but, it won't be int rather Integer.

In the case of int[] the default value is 0. But in the case of Integer[] the default value is null.

If we assign a value to an index in int[] it will directly be stored. 

But in the case of Integer[] it will just store the address of that integer value.

Now for the meaning part. dp[i] will store the minimum number of moves needed to move from i to n.

<i><b>Direction: </b></i>

Similar to the previous scenario, here also the subproblem "Minimum moves to go from n to n" is smaller than the subproblem "Minimum moves to go from 0 to n". 

Hence the direction will also be backward.

<i><b>Travel and Solve: </b></i>

Let's consider the array: [3, 2, 4, 2, 0, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2]. n=10;

The trivial case is that the minimum moves to go from 10 to 10 and the answer is 0.

Now in the 9-th value, we take a max of two jumps. If we take a jump of 2 we will go outside the array, hence we can only take a jump of size 1. 

Thus dp[9] = dp[10] + 1 i.e. dp[9] = 1.

If we keep doing it this way we will eventually solve the entire dp array. 

We will ask you to try to solve it yourself.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    int[] arr = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      arr[i] = scn.nextInt();
    }
    Integer[] dp = new Integer[n + 1];
    dp[n] = 0;

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (arr[i] == 0)
        continue;
      int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
      for (int j = 1; j <= arr[i] && i + j < dp.length; j++) {
        if (dp[i + j] != null) {
          min = Math.min(min, dp[i + j]);
        }
      }
      if (min != Integer.MAX_VALUE)
        dp[i] = min + 1;
    }
    System.out.println(dp[0]);
    scn.close();
  }
}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis </b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity : </b></i>
O(n2)

Here we are running to loops. Outerloop runs n times and the inner loop can run n times in the worst case. 

And within the inner loop, we are just adding hence we will get constant time. So it's O(n*n) = O(n2).

<i><b>Space Complexity : </b></i>
O(n)

Here we are just using one dp[] array of length n+1, to store the results. 

Thus the space complexity will be O(n+1) = O(n).

So hence we conclude the question here.
