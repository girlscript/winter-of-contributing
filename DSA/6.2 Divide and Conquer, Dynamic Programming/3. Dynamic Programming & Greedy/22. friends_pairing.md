You are given a number n, representing the number of friends.

Each friend can stay single or pair up with any of their friends.

You are required to print the number of ways in which these friends can stay single or pair up.


<i><b>Question Link: </b></i>[Click](https://www.pepcoding.com/resources/online-java-foundation/dynamic-programming-and-greedy/friends-pairing-official/ojquestion).

Let's take an example to understand this. Let's say there are 3 friends, and we will represent them as 1, 2, 3. You can choose any name for them.

Now, what do you think are the different ways we can pair them up or keep them single.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/friends_pairing/friends_pairing_1.png">

We can keep all of them single. Or we can do these.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/friends_pairing/friends_pairing_4.png">

Hence there were 4 ways to arrange them. 1-2-3, 12-3, 1-23, 13-2. Thus the answer for 3 friends will be 4.

I will suggest you think about the problem for a few minutes.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach (DP):</b></i>

Now, let's try to understand first how to create these pairings and then look into calculating the count. Here you can see we just drew all the possibilities:

If you have difficulty understanding this watch the video from [2:10 - 3:05].Now, we will traverse the Euler path to get all pairings. We are back at 23, we will get two pairings 2-3, and 23-.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/friends_pairing/friends_pairing_6.png">

Now when we reach 123 we will add a single 1 to those pairings.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/friends_pairing/friends_pairing_7.png">

Now when we traverse the remaining 3. We will get just one pairing i.e 12-3.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/friends_pairing/friends_pairing_8.png">

And finally, from 2 we will have 13-2.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/friends_pairing/friends_pairing_9.png">

Clearly, we again reached our original answer of 4. And the pairings are

1-2-3 1-23 12-3 13-2
If you still have some doubts watch the video from [5:09 - 8:03]

Let's say we already have the count for n-1 friends now, we have another new friend. We can either keep that friend single this will give us the same pairings as that of n-1 friends. 

Also, we can pair this new friend with the n-1 friends and for each of them, the answer will be the count for n-2 friends. So (n-1)* [ pairings for n-2 friends]. 

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/friends_pairing/friends_pairing_10.png">

This generates the dp relation of
```
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i-1)*dp[i-2]
```

Clearly, we will need a 1-D array to store the values. This problem is again very similar to that of Fibonacci only that it has this new (i-1) factor. Rest everything is the same. 

So try to code it yourself first.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];

    dp[0] = 1;
    dp[1] = 1;

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
      dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2];
    }
    System.out.println(dp[n]);
    scn.close();
  }
}
```
<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity Explanation : </b></i>

We are just using a single loop with n iterations and in each iteration, we are performing constant-time operations. Hence it will be O(n).

<i><b>Space Complexity Explanation : </b></i>

We are using a single 1-D array of size n so the complexity will be O(n) as well. Now the question is can you solve it in less than O(n) space? 

I will give a hint: Look at which values does dp[i] depend on. Isn't it enough to just store the last 2 values?

So hence we conclude the question here.
