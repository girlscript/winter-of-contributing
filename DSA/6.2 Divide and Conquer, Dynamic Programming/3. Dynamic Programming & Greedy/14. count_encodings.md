You are given a string of digits. (will never start with a 0)

You are required to encode the str as per the following rules

```
1 -> a

2 -> b

3 -> c

..

25 -> y

26 -> z
```

You are required to calculate and print the count of encodings for the string str.

For 123 -> there are 3 encodings. abc, aw, lc

For 993 -> there is 1 encoding. iic

For 013 -> This is an invalid input. A string starting with 0 will not be passed.

For 103 -> there is 1 encoding. jc

For 303 -> there are 0 encodings. But such a string may have passed. In this case print 0.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

We know there are three steps to a DP problem.

<i><b>Storage and Meaning:</b></i>

We will store the results in an array, let's say dp. Now dp[i] will store the number of encodings possible till the i-th char. This is our meaning.

<i><b>Direction: </b></i>

Clearly, if we are at the 0-th char the number of encodings is 1. [Unless we have an invalid string], So this problem is easier compared to calculating the number of encodings till the n-th char. So we found out the direction which is from left to right.

<i><b>Travel and Solve: </b></i>

Now to solve this we will need to find our recursive relation. 

Let's say we are at the i-th char then we can either consider the i-th char independently or attach the i-th char with the previous value. 

But in both cases, we need to check the validity. So, in a way, it becomes a slight variation of the Fibonacci problem.
Let's take this example arr: [2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1]

First, let's solve the trivial case.

We can create an encoding of "b" using 2. So dp[0]=1

Now, for 3 we have two options:

Attach 3 to the previous 2 which gives us 23 i.e "w".
Keep 3 separate which gives us "bc".

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/count_encodings/count_encodings_2.png">

Now for 1 we can just attach "a" to the previous encodings, giving us "bca" and "wa". But we can try one more thing: attach 1 to 3 and keep 2 separate. So it will be 2-31. 

But there is no valid encoding for 31. Hence we cannot consider this. So here dp[2] = 2

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/count_encodings/count_encodings_3.png">

Now that we have 0, we cannot consider 0 independently i.e 231-0 will not be valid. 

Rather we should consider 23-10. Where 23 gives up 2 encodings and 10 stands for "j".

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/count_encodings/count_encodings_4.png">

Now that we have 1 we can consider it separately and simply attach "a" to all the encodings before it. i.e 2310-1.

Now there is another split i.e 231-01 but 01 is an invalid split. So we won't consider it.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/count_encodings/count_encodings_5.png">

Now for the final element 1, we can make two splits. Like 23101-1 and 2310-11.

In the first split, we can simply append "a" to the previous encodings.

In the second split, we have to append "k" to the 2nd previous encodings, Hence we have 4 encodings in total.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/count_encodings/count_encodings_6.png">

Clearly, for every i we are looking at two things i-1 and i-2. Let's look at the various combinations of i and i-1

i = 0 and i-1 = 0

Here we cannot keep i separate nor can we take i and i-1 together. So it is an invalid scenario.

i = non-zero and i-1 = 0

In this case, we can only treat i separately. We cannot treat i-1 and i together because they will form numbers like 03, 04 which are invalid.

So one case here.

i = 0 and i-1 = non-zero

Here we cannot keep i separate rather can add i and i-1 together. So there is also just one case here.

i = non-zero and i-1 = non-zero

Here we can keep i separate. We can also keep i and i-1 together but on the condition that the number they form should be less than 27.

Now we can move onto the code. Try to code it yourself if you are stuck then you should check out the solution.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    String str = scn.next();
    int[] dp = new int[str.length()];

    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < str.length(); i++) {
      if (str.charAt(i - 1) == '0' && str.charAt(i) == '0') {
        dp[i] = 0;
      } else if (str.charAt(i - 1) == '0' && str.charAt(i) != '0') {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
      } else if (str.charAt(i - 1) != '0' && str.charAt(i) == '0') {
        if (str.charAt(i - 1) == '1' || str.charAt(i - 1) == '2') {
          dp[i] = (i >= 2 ? dp[i - 2] : 1);
        }
      } else {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
        if (Integer.parseInt(str.substring(i - 1, i + 1)) <= 26) {
          dp[i] += (i >= 2 ? dp[i - 2] : 1);
        }
      }
    }
    System.out.println(dp[str.length() - 1]);
    scn.close();
  }
}
```
<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity : </b></i>
O(n)

The approach for this is very similar to that of Fibonacci except this has more constraints. But the time complexity is the same. We are just making a single loop. 

And in each iteration we are performing a constant time operation hence it is linear. i.e O(n).

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>
O(n)

Usually for dp problems space complexity is the length of the dp array we create. So here it is O(n). Where n is the length of the string.

So hence we conclude the question here.
