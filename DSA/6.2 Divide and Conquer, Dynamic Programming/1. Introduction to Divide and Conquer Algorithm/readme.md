# Introduction to Divide & Conquer Algorithm

## Divide & Conquer Algorithm

Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic pattern. In algorithmic methods, the design is to take a dispute on a huge input, break the input into minor pieces, decide the problem on each of the small pieces, and then merge the piecewise solutions into a global solution. This mechanism of solving the problem is called the Divide & Conquer Strategy.

Divide and Conquer algorithm consists of a dispute using the following three steps :

* Divide the original problem into a set of subproblems.
* Conquer: Solve every subproblem individually, recursively.
* Combine: Put together the solutions of the subproblems to get the solution to the whole problem.
