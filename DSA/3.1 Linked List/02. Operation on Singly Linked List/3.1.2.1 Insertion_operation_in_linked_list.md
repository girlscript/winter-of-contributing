## <p align = "center">***What is Linked list?*** </p>

If the memory is allocated before the execution of a program, it is fixed and cannot be changed. We have to adopt an alternative strategy to allocate memory only when it is required. There is a special data structure called **Linked list** that provides a more flexible storage system and it does not require the use of arrays.

Linked lists are special list of some data elements linked to one another. The logical ordering is represented by having each element pointing to the next element. Each element is called a ***node***, which has two parts. **INFO** part which stores the information and **POINTER** which points to the next element.


## <p align = "center">***Insertion operation*** </p>


To insert an element into the linked list, following three things should be done:<br>
1. Allocating a node
2. Assigning the data
3. Adjusting the pointers

Inserting a new node into the linked list has the following three instances:

1. Insertion at the beginning of the linked list.
2. Insertion at the end of the linked list.
3. Insertion at the specified position within the linked list.

<br><h2>**1. Insertion at the beginning of the Linked list** </h2><br>

<i><h3> ***Algorithm*** </i></h3><br>
This algorithm inserts node toAdd with info "data" as the first node of the linked list pointed by head.

1. Allocate memory for new node i.e., toAdd.
2. Assign the data to the toAdd node i.e., toAdd -> info = data.
3. Make the toAdd next pointer pointing to the head i.e., toAdd -> next = head.
4. Assign head to point to the toAdd node i.e., head = toAdd.

<br><i><h3> ***Code for implementation of algorithm*** </i></h3>
```
class LinkedList<T> {

    Node<T> head; //head of the linked list

    static class Node<T> { //class to construct a specific node in a list

        Node<T> next;  //next pointer field of a node
        T data;   //data field of a node

        Node(T data) {
            this.data = data;
            next= null;
        }
    }

    //function to insert a node at the beginning of the linked list
    public void insertAtBegin(T data){

        Node<T> toAdd = new Node<>(data);  //node to be inserted with given data

        toAdd.next = head;
        head = toAdd;

    }
}

```



<br><h2>**2. Insertion at the end of the Linked list**</h2><br>

<i><h3> ***Algorithm*** </i></h3><br>
This algorithm inserts node toAdd with info "data" as the last node of the linked list pointed by head.

1. Allocate memory for new node i.e., toAdd.
2. Assign the data to the toAdd node i.e., toAdd -> info = data.
3. Traverse to the last node of the list.
4. Make the next of the last node pointing to the newly created node i.e., last -> next = toAdd.
5. Make the next pointer of the toAdd pointing to null i.e, toAdd -> next = null.



<br><i><h3> ***Code for implementation of algorithm*** </i></h3>
```
class LinkedList<T> {

    Node<T> head; //head of the linked list

    static class Node<T> { //class to construct a specific node in a list

        Node<T> next;  //next pointer field of a node
        T data;   //data field of a node

        Node(T data) {
            this.data = data;
            next= null;
        }
    }

    //function to insert a node in the linked list at the specified position (according to zero based indexing)
    void insertAtGivenPos(T data , int pos){

        Node<T> toAdd = new Node<>(data);  //node to be inserted with given data
        Node<T> prev = head; //node present at the position just previous to where new node has to be inserted

        if(pos!=0 && head == null){ //if linked list is empty and position is other than zero, then insertion can cause error
            System.out.println("Node cannot be inserted in an empty linked list at the specified position.");
            return;
        }

        if(pos == 0){ //if node has to be inserted at the 0th position
           toAdd.next = head;
           head = toAdd;
           return;
        }

        for(int i = 0 ; i< pos-1 ; i++){
            prev = prev.next;
        }

        toAdd.next = prev.next;
        prev.next = toAdd;
    }
}

```

<br><h2>**3. Insertion at the specified postion within the Linked list**</h2><br>

<i><h3> ***Algorithm*** </i></h3><br>

This algorithm inserts node toAdd with info "data" at specified location in the linked list pointed by head.
1. Allocate memory for new node i.e., toAdd.
2. Assign the data to the toAdd node i.e., toAdd -> info = data.
3. Traverse to the node, say "prev" in the linked list present at the position just previous to where new node has to be inserted.
4. Make the next of toAdd pointing to prev.next i.e., toAdd -> next = prev -> next.
5. Make the next of prev pointing to the toAdd i.e., prev -> next = toAdd.
