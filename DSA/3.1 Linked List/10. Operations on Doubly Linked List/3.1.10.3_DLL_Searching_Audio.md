# Brief summary on the audio clip :

It contains how to approach the problem given and space and time complexities of the problem.The approach is similar to that of search operation in an array or singly linked list.

## Conclusion :

The question was to find whether a key is present in the doubly linked list or not.
We approached the problem by traversing the list and setting flag to true on finding the key.

***TIME COMPLEXITY : O(N) where N is the length of the list.***

***SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1)  Since we just using few variables for our pointers.***
