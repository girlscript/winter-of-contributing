## Brief summary on the audio clip :

It contains what is a doubly linked list how to approach the problem given and space and time complexities of the problem.

## Conclusion :

    The question was to insert a new node in a doubly linked list. This problem has  3 cases :
        1. INSERTION AT HEAD
        2. INSERTION AT TAIL
        2. INSERTION AT ANY GIVEN POSITION (OR AFTER ANY GIVEN NODE) IN THE LIST.

**TIME COMPLEXITY : O(1)**
**_For all 3 situations as we are just manipulating the previous and next pointer of our nodes ._**
**SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1)**
**_Since we just using few variables for our pointers ._**
