## Searching in Doubly Linked List ##

### Linked List: ###
Linked lists are linear data structures in which elements are stored in non-contiguous manner using pointers.

### Doubly linked List: ###
Doubly linked lists are a type of linked lists in which there is a pointer to the next node as well the previous node. It provides the flexiblity of traversing in both the directions.

### **Searching in Doubly Linked List:** ###

**Algorithm:**

1. Create a temp node pointing to the head of the list.

    `ptr = head`

2. Declare a variable and intialise it to 0.

    `i=0`

3. Traverse the list until the pointer(ptr) becomes null. Keep shifting pointer to its next and increasing i by +1.

4. Compare each element of the list with the item which is to be searched.

5. If the item matched with any node value then the location of that value I will be returned from the function else NULL is returned.

**Program in Java:**

        public class SearchList {  
  
        //Represent a node of the doubly linked list  
  
        class Node{  
        int data;  
        Node previous;  
        Node next;  
  
        public Node(int data) {  
            this.data = data;  
        }  
        }  
  
        //Represent the head and tail of the doubly linked list  
        Node head, tail = null;  
  
        //addNode() will add a node to the list  
        public void addNode(int data) {  
         //Create a new node  
         Node newNode = new Node(data);  
  
        //If list is empty  
        if(head == null) {  
            //Both head and tail will point to newNode  
            head = tail = newNode;  
            //head's previous will point to null  
            head.previous = null;  
            //tail's next will point to null, as it is the last node of the list  
            tail.next = null;  
        }  
        else {  
            //newNode will be added after tail such that tail's next will point to newNode  
            tail.next = newNode;  
            //newNode's previous will point to tail  
            newNode.previous = tail;  
            //newNode will become new tail  
            tail = newNode;  
            //As it is last node, tail's next will point to null  
            tail.next = null;  
        }  
        }  
  
        //searchNode() will search a given node in the list  
        public void searchNode(int value) {  
        int i = 1;  
        boolean flag = false;  
        //Node current will point to head  
        Node current = head;  
  
        //Checks whether the list is empty  
        if(head == null) {  
            System.out.println("List is empty");  
            return;  
        }  
        while(current != null) {  
            //Compare value to be searched with each node in the list  
            if(current.data == value) {  
                flag = true;  
                break;  
            }  
            current = current.next;  
            i++;  
        }  
        if(flag)  
             System.out.println("Node is present in the list at the position : " + i);  
        else  
             System.out.println("Node is not present in the list");  
        }  
  
        public static void main(String[] args) {  
  
        SearchList dList = new SearchList();  
        //Add nodes to the list  
        dList.addNode(1);  
        dList.addNode(5);  
        dList.addNode(4);  
        dList.addNode(2);  
        dList.addNode(3);  
  
        //Search for node 4 in the list  
        dList.searchNode(4);  
        //Search for node 9 in the list  
        dList.searchNode(9);  
        }  
        }  


**Output:**

`Node is present in the list at the position: 3
Node is not present in the list`

**Time Complexity:**
As we are traversing the list once, the time complexity is `O(n)`.
