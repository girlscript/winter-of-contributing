## What is Doubly Linked List ?

Doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list in which a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the sequence. 

Therefore, in a doubly linked list, a node consists of three parts: node data, pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer) , pointer to the previous node (previous pointer). 

A sample node in a doubly linked list is shown in the figure.

A doubly linked list containing three nodes having numbers from 1 to 3 in their data part, is shown in the following image.
