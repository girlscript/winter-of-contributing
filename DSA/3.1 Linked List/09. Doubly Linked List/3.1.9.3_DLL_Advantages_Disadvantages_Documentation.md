1. Reversing the Linked List becomes quite easy.
2. Deletion of nodes is easy as compared to Singly Linkedlists since Singly Linked list requires a pointer to the node and previous node to be deleted but in Doubly Linked Lists it only requires the pointer to be deleted.
3. Memory Allocation and Reallocation is done during execution.
4. In Doubly Linked Lists we can iterate in both directions i.e front and back movement is supported.
5. Comes in handy when implementing several other Data Structures.
6. Can be used for functionalities like Undo/Redo.
7. Used by a thread scheduler in many operating systems to maintain a list of all running processes.


## Disadvantages of Doubly LinkedList

1. No Random Access of elements.
2. Operations require more time due to the overhead of handling extra pointers as compared to singly-linked lists.
3. Store extra memory as compared to Singly LinkedList.
