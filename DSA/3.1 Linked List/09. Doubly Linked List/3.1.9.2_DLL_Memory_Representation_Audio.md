A doubly linked list is a data structure that contains three parts or blocks within a node, one part is for storing the data and the other two are for storing the addresses of the previous and next nodes. Because of this additional previous pointer, the doubly linked list requires more memory for each node as compared to a singly linked list.  However, the storage is non-contiguous.  The available memory is distributed in a scattered manner, wherever the required memory is found. By using this method of memory allocation, the memory usage becomes very efficient as random nodes can be added at random addresses wherever the required space is available. And we can easily walkthrough these nodes using the addresses of the previous and next nodes.
```
public class Node
{
	public int value;
	public Node next;
	public Node prev;

	Node(int data)
	{
		this.value=data;
	}
}
```
