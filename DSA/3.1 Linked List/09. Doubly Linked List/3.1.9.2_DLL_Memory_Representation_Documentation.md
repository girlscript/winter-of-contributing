# Memory Representation Of Doubly Linked List

Doubly linked list (DLL) is a data structure containing information about the previous and next node of the sequence. A typical node in DLL looks like this

Structure of node in DLL :

```C++
struct node {
  int data;
  struct node *prev;
  struct node *next;
}
```

DLL occupies more space compared to singly linked list as it stores previous and next both node addresses. The memory representation is shown below:

- Each node in DLL has 3 part: data, previous and next node pointer
- DLL consumes a lot of space due to two additional pointers
- In the image B's previous node is A and next is C
- Also, the nodes need not be continuous
- 1000, 2006 etc. represent memory
- -1 in previous pointer indicates that the node is head
- If we get -1 in next pointer of a node then that indicates the end of DLL

DLL is much more efficient than singly linked list. Insertion and deletion operations have constant time complexity.
