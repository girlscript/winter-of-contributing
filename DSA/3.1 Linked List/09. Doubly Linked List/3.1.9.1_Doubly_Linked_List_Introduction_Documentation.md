## Doubly Linked List

Doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list in which a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the sequence. Therefore, in a doubly linked list, a node consists of three parts: node data, pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer) , pointer to the previous node (previous pointer). A sample node in a doubly linked list is shown in the figure.

Following are the important terms to understand the concept of doubly linked list:-

* **Link:-** Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.

* **Next:-** Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.

* **Prev:-** Each link of a linked list contains a link to the previous link called Prev.

* **LinkedList:-** A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First and to the last link called Last.

As per the above illustration, following are the important points to be considered.

* Doubly Linked List contains a link element called first and last.

* Each link carries a data field(s) and two link fields called next and prev.

* Each link is linked with its next link using its next link.

* Each link is linked with its previous link using its previous link.

* The last link carries a link as null to mark the end of the list.


In a singly linked list, we could traverse only in one direction, because each node contains address of the next node and it doesn't have any record of its previous nodes. However, doubly linked list overcome this limitation of singly linked list. Due to the fact that, each node of the list contains the address of its previous node, we can find all the details about the previous node as well by using the previous address stored inside the previous part of each node.

## Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//node declaration for doubly linked list
struct Node {
   int data;
   struct Node *prev, *next;
};
  
Node* newNode(int val)
{
   Node* temp = new Node;
   temp->data = val;
   temp->prev = temp->next = nullptr;
   return temp;
}
void displayList(Node* head)
{
   while (head->next != nullptr) {
      cout << head->data << " <==> ";
      head = head->next;
      }
   cout << head->data << endl;
}
  
// Insert a new node at the head of the list
void insert(Node** head, int node_data)
{
   Node* temp = newNode(node_data);
   temp->next = *head;
   (*head)->prev = temp;
   (*head) = temp;
}
  
// reverse the doubly linked list
void reverseList(Node** head)
{
   Node* left = *head, * right = *head;
  
   // traverse entire list and set right next to right
   while (right->next != nullptr)
   right = right->next;
  
   //swap left and right data by moving them towards each other till they meet or cross
   while (left != right && left->prev != right) {
  
      // Swap left and right pointer data
      swap(left->data, right->data);
  
      // Advance left pointer
      left = left->next;
  
      // Advance right pointer
      right = right->prev;
   }
}
int main()
{
   Node* headNode = newNode(5);
   insert(&headNode, 4);
   insert(&headNode, 3);
   insert(&headNode, 2);
   insert(&headNode, 1);
   cout << "Original doubly linked list: " << endl;
   displayList(headNode);
   cout << "Reverse doubly linked list: " << endl;
   reverseList(&headNode);
   displayList(headNode);
  
   return 0;
}
```

## Output

```
Original doubly linked list: 
1 <==> 2 <==> 3 <==> 4 <==> 5
Reverse doubly linked list: 
5 <==> 4 <==> 3 <==> 2 <==> 1
```

## Doubly Linked List Complexity

Doubly Linked List Complexity | Time Complexity | Space Complexity
----------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------
**Insertion Operation**       |   O(1) or O(n)  |      O(1)
**Deletion Operation**        |      O(1)       |      O(1)

   **1. Complexity of Insertion Operation**

   * The insertion operations that do not require traversal have the time complexity of `O(1)`

   * And, insertion that requires traversal has time complexity of `O(n)`.

   * The space complexity is `O(1)`.

   **2. Complexity of Deletion Operation**

   * All deletion operations run with time complexity of `O(1)`.

   * And, the space complexity is `O(1)`.



## Doubly Linked List Applications

* Redo and undo functionality in software.

* Forward and backward navigation in browsers.

* For navigation systems where forward and backward navigation is required.
