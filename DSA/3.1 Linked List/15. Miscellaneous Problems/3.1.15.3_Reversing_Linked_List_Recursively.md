# Reversing a Linked List Recursively



Here in this documentation I will be discussing about one of the most famous questions on Linked List i.e. how to reverse a Linked List Recursively. We can solve this problem either iteratively or recursively. I will be discussing the later solution here. The only pre-requisite for this post is that you should know what a linked list data structure is and basic knowledge of how recursion works.

So without much further talks let's get started : )



### Understanding the Problem

As we know a basic linked list node consists of mainly two parts : 

1. Value, and 
2. a pointer to the next node.

The first node of the Linked List is commonly referred as head. In a standard Linked List the first node's next pointer point to second, second node's next pointer point to third, third node's next pointer to fourth and so on. And the last node's next pointer points to NULL.

Now we have to reverse the linked list such that the head points to last node, the first node's next pointer points to null and all the remaining next pointers are reversed in place.



### Approaching the Problem

As this is a recursive problem it consists of 3 basic steps which we can call as the pillar of recursion. We will see how our problem is concerned with these three steps of recursion.

1. **Assumption :**  Our main assumption is to reverse the linked list in a recursive manner.

2. **Main Logic :** We will start reversing from the head node and keep calling the node pointed by next pointer recursively before actually performing the reverse operation.

3. **Base Case :**  The Base Case will happen when we reach the last node as its next pointer points to null so we will return from there and do the actually reversing operation.

   

As now we have understood the three basics steps we will apply it to our problem in finding a proper solution



### Recursive Algorithm 

For simple understanding of how to reverse a Linked List recursively we will be following a simple algorithm consisting of few basic steps.

1. Firstly we need to create a function that take head of a linked list as an argument.
2. Then in that function we will traverse recursively and except the first node make all nodes point to itself which will reverse the links.
3. If we reach the end of the linked list, we start returning to the previous recursive call. This is the base case.
4. We have to explicitly make the next pointer of first node point to null which will indicate it as the last node.
5. Now we just need to call that recursive function with the head of the Linked List and our job is done.

###  Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity :** As we are traversing the linked list only once in a linear fashion so the time complexity is linear O(n).

**Space Complexity :** No extra space is needed but as the recursion is being used, O(n) space is required for the recursion stack.



### Complete CPP Code



```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
    Node(int data)
    {
        this->data = data;
        next = NULL;
    }
};
  
struct LinkedList {
    Node* head;
    LinkedList(){
        head = NULL;
    }
  
    // Function to reverse the list
    Node* reverse(Node* node){
        if (node == NULL)
            return NULL;

        // if current node is the last node
        if (node->next == NULL) {
            head = node;
            return node;
        }
        // recur for the next node
        Node* node1 = reverse(node->next);

        // Change the links accordingly
        node1->next = node;
        node->next = NULL;
        return node;
    }

    void print(){
        struct Node* temp = head;
        while (temp != NULL) {
            cout << temp->data << " ";
            temp = temp->next;
        }
    }
  
    void push(int data){
        Node* temp = new Node(data);
        temp->next = head;
        head = temp;
    }
};
  
int main(){
    LinkedList ll;
    ll.push(4);
    ll.push(3);
    ll.push(2);
    ll.push(1);
    cout << "Given linked list\n";
    ll.print();
    ll.reverse(ll.head);
    cout << "\nReversed Linked list \n";
    ll.print();
    return 0;
}

```
