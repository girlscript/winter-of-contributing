# Remove duplicate element from sorted Linked List 

### Problem Description: 
#### Given a sorted linked list which has some duplicate elements, your task is to remove all the duplicate elements from the given Linked List.
##
```For Example: 
Input: 1->1->2->3->3->NULL
Output: 1->2->3->NULL
```

## Possible Solutions:
### 1. Iterative Solution
### 2. Recursive Solution
#
###  Iterative Solution:
#### We iteratively traverse the entire Linked List, going to each node one by one, we will compare that node with the adjacent node and if the data value for both the nodes are the same it means that the node is a duplicate. We will then de-link one of the duplicate nodes by moving the pointer to the next node and will follow the same procedure for the rest of the nodes till we reach the end of the linked list.
## 

```c++
Node *removeDuplicates(Node *head)
{
    Node *ptr = head;
    while(ptr and ptr->next){
        if(ptr->data == ptr->next->data)
            ptr->next = ptr->next->next;
        else
            ptr = ptr->next;
    }
    return head;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis
> Time Complexity: O(N)
> Space Complexity: O(1)

## Recursive Solution
#### We need to think about the base condition. The operation is to compare two nodes and to see if the data values are the same or not. If the nodes match we will save the neighborâ€™s address and delete the duplicate node. We will recursively call for the rest of the nodes and leave the sub-tasks on recursion.
#
```c++
Node *removeDuplicates(Node *head)
{
    if (!head)
        return NULL;
    head->next = removeDuplicates(head->next);
    
    if (head->next and head->next->data == head->data) {
        Node* res = head->next;
        delete head;
        return res;
    }
    return head;
}
```
