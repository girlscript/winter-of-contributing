# Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list

## Problem Statement
#### Given an unsorted linked list of N nodes, the task is to remove duplicate elements from this unsorted Linked List.

##
```For Example: 
Input: 5->2->2->4->NULL
Output: 5->2->4->NULL
```

## Possible Solutions:
### 1. Using two loops
### 2. Using Hashing
#
### Using Loops (Brute Force) :
#

* Here we only use two loops, the outer loop is used to pick the elements one by one and the inner loop compares the picked element with the rest of the elements.
* If the adjacent node is having the same data than that node is deleted .
* Then pointer points to the next unique node till the outer loop is not complete or when all nodes have been checked.

#

```c++
void removeDuplicates(struct Node* head) {
        Node *ptr1, *ptr2, *duplicate;
        ptr1 = head;
     
        while (ptr1 and ptr1->next) {
            ptr2 = ptr1; // points ptr2 to ptr1
            
            while (ptr2->next) {  // keeps checking till ptr2 next exist
                if (ptr1->data == ptr2->next->data) { // if both nodes data is same
                    duplicate = ptr2->next; // pointer points to the duplicate node 
                    ptr2->next = duplicate->next; // link ptr2 to the next of duplicate node
                    delete (duplicate); // free the memory by deleting that duplicate node
                }
                else 
                    ptr2 = ptr2->next; // point ptr2 to the next node
            }
            ptr1 = ptr1->next; //else point pt1 to its next node
        }
    }
```
> Time Complexity: O(n^2)
> 
> Space Complexity: O(1)

### Using Hashing:
#####
* We traverse the link list from head to end. For every element, we check whether it is in the hash table.
* If yes, we delete that node, else we put it in the hash table. 
#
```c++
void removeDuplicates(struct Node* head) {
        unordered_set<int> visited;
        struct Node *curr = head, *prev = NULL;
        
        while (curr) {
            if (visited.find(curr->data) != visited.end()) { // if current data has been visited
                prev->next = curr->next; // point previous to the current's next node
                delete (curr); // delete the current / duplicate node
            }
            else {
                visited.insert(curr->data); // if not visited earlier, insert it in the hash table
                prev = curr; // point previous to the current node
            }
            curr = prev->next; // point current node to the next of previous node
        }
    }  
```
