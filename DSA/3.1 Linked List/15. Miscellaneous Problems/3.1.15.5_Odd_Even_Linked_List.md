# Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.
  

### Constraints
```
n == number of nodes in the linked list
0 <= n <= 10^4
-10^6 <= Node.val <= 10^6
```



## Example 1
### Input
```
head = [1,2,3,4,5]
```
### Output
```
[1,3,5,2,4]
```
### Explanation
```
1,3,5 are present at nodes with odd indices and 2,4 are present at nodes with even indices.
Hence after grouping,all odd indices nodes will come first followed by even indices nodes.
```
## Example 2
### Input
```
head = [2,1,3,5,6,4]
```
### Output
```
[2,3,6,1,5,4]
```
### Explanation
```
2,3,6 are present at nodes with odd indices and 1,5,4 are present at nodes with even indices.
Hence after grouping,all odd indices nodes will come first followed by even indices nodes. 

```

## Example 3
### Input
```
head = []
```
### Output
```
[]
```
### Explanation
```
Since linked list is empty,no changes will occur.
```

## Example 4
### Input
```
head = [5]
```
### Output
```
[5]
```
### Explanation
```
Since one node is present in linked list at odd index,no changes will occur.
```

## Algorithm
1. Check if head is null,then simply return head.Otherwise proceed to step 2.
2. Initialize two pointers,one odd with head,other even with head->next.Also initialize evenHead with head->next.It will work as head for even nodes.
3. Iterate in linked list till both even and even->next is not null.
4. Sice odd nodes will be at alternate indices,so at odd->next put odd->next->next.
5. Similarly at even->next,put even->next->next.
6. At end simply put evenHead at odd->next and return head.


## Code

```C++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* oddEvenList(ListNode* head) {
        if(!head) return head;
        ListNode *odd=head, *evenhead=head->next, *even = evenhead;
        while(even && even->next)
        {
            odd->next = odd->next->next;
            even->next = even->next->next;
            odd = odd->next;
            even = even->next;
        }
        odd->next = evenhead;
        return head;
        
    }
};
```
## Time Complexity
Time complexity will be O(number of nodes) i.e. O(n).

## Space Complexity
We are not using any extra space,just updating the given array i.e. Space Complexity will be O(1).
