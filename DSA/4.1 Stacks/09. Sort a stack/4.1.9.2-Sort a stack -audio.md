# Sort a Stack

## What is Stack?
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). There are many real-life examples of a stack.

## Algorithm for Sort a Stack
* Create a temporary stack say tmpStack.
* While input stack is NOT empty do this:
** Pop an element from input stack call it temp
** while temporary stack is NOT empty and top of temporary stack is greater than temp,
** pop from temporary stack and push it to the input stack
** push temp in temporary stack
* The sorted numbers are in tmpStack
