# Operations On Stack

Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

If you have trouble visualizing stacks, just assume a stack of books.

- In a stack of books, you can only see the top book
- If you want to access any other book, you would first need to remove the books on top of it
- The bottom-most book in the stack was put first and can only be removed at the last after all books on top of it have been removed.

### Mainly the following three basic operations are performed in the stack

- Push: Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
- Pop: Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
- Peek or Top: Returns the top element of the stack.
- isEmpty: Returns true if the stack is empty, else false.

### Time Complexities of operations on stack

push(), pop(), isEmpty() and peek() all take O(1) time. We do not run any loop in any of these operations.

### Applications of stack

- Balancing of symbols
- Infix to Postfix /Prefix conversion
- Redo-undo features at many places like editors, photoshop.
- Forward and backward feature in web browsers
- Used in many algorithms like Tower of Hanoi, tree traversals, stock span problem, histogram problem.
- Backtracking is one of the algorithm designing techniques. Some examples of backtracking are the Knight-Tour problem, N-Queen problem, find your way through a maze, and game-like chess or checkers in all these problems we dive into someway if that way is not efficient we come back to the previous state and go into some another path. To get back from a current state we need to store the previous state for that purpose we need a stack.
- In Graph Algorithms like Topological Sorting and Strongly Connected Components
- In Memory management, any modern computer uses a stack as the primary management for a running purpose. Each program that is running in a computer system has its own memory allocations
- String reversal is also another application of stack. Here one by one each character gets inserted into the stack. So the first character of the string is on the bottom of the stack and the last element of a string is on the top of the stack. After Performing the pop operations on the stack we get a string in reverse order.
 
### PUSH Operation
What changes are made to the stack when a new element is pushed?

- A new element is inserted on top
- The value of top increases by 1

<b> What if the stack is filled to its capacity? </b>

We shall check if the stack if full before inserting a new element and throw an error if it is.

Now, let us implement this simply

    void push(int item)
    {
        if ( top == capacity - 1 )
            print( "Stack overflow!" )
        else
        {
            arr[top+1] = item
            top = top + 1
        }
    }
  
  
### POP Operation

<b>What changes are made to the stack internally for a pop operation?</b>

- The top element is removed
- The value of top is decreased by 1

Letâ€™s try implementing it now

    void pop()
    {
        if ( isEmpty() == True )
            print( "Stack is empty!" )
        else
            top = top - 1
    }
    
### Peek and isEmpty Operation
Peek and isEmpty are quite simple to implement. 

    int peek()
    {
        if ( isEmpty() == True )
        {
            print( "Stack is empty!" )
            return -1
        }
        else 
            return arr[top]
    }
    bool isEmpty()
    {
        if ( top == -1 )
            return True
        else
            return False
    }
