# Implement Stack using Priority Queue or Heap

## What is Priority Queue?
A Priority Queue is a abstract data type similar to queue & stack data structures in which each element has priority associated with it. Every element is given a priority number. In conclusion, the elements with high priority are prefered or served before elements with low priority.

## Algorithm to implement Stack using Priority Queue or Heap :

* First create a class stack with the priority queue. In addition to queue initialise a variable count = 0 inside it.
* Create a function push() which accepts an integer value as a parameter. Increment the count and push the pair of count and element in the priority queue.
* Create function top() and return the element stored in top i.e. second part of the pair stored at top of the priority queue.
* After that, create function isEmpty(). Return true if the priority queue is empty else return false.
* Similarly, create function pop() and check if queue is empty print “Empty Stack”. Else decrement the count and pop the top of the priority queue.
* Traverse the stack and while stack is not empty print the top and pop the top.
