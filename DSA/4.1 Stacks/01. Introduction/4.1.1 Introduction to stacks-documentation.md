# Introduction to Stack Data Structure 

* Stack is a leniar data structure in which the addition , deletion and searching operations are done from the one end which is called the top of stack (TOS).

* In stack the order of operations is Last In First Out Order (LIFO).

* It can be understood by real life example of a pile of books. In a stack of books we put books one over the other and when we want to remove a book we have to srtart removing the books from the top.

* Stacks works exactly like that.

# Working Of A Stack

The basic functions of stack data structure are push and pop. Let's know more about it.

## Insertion

* Insertion in a stack is done by push function. When we insert any element in empty stack it occupies the bottom most place .

* When the next element is pushed into the stack it will occupy the place just above the previous element.

## Deletion/Removal

* Deletion in a stack is performed by the pop function . The element on the top is removed first and the the next element in Last In First Out (LIFO) order .

</br>
* Then the next element is popped out .

</br>
* It is done until the stack is empty.
