# TERNARY SEARCH
## INTRODUCTION
Ternary means consisting or involving three .  
Ternary search is **divide and conquer** algorithm that can be used to find an element in the array.  
As in binary search we divide the array in two parts and we perform searching by calculating the mid  and comparing it with the element to be searched ,in this we divide the array into three parts and we have two mids which can be calculated as shown below,    
  
` mid1= l + (r-l)/3`    
  
`mid2=r-(r-l)/3`    
  
As like binary search ,array must be sorted for performing binary search.  
Let us call **key** the element we are searching.  
 ## PROCEDURE
- First ,find the mid1 and mid2
- Check if key is equal to mid1 then we will return mid1
- Check if key is equal to mid2 then we will return mid2 
- If not,then ccheck if it is less than mid1 ,we will perform ternary search on the first part 
- if it is greater than first element then we will compare the key with mid2 element ,if it is greater than mid2 we will perform ternary search on third part
- if it is smaller than mid2 ,we will perform ternary search on the middle part
- repeat until l<=r  
  
  **DRY RUN**

 ## IMPLEMENTATION ##
  
**RECURSUVE APPROACH**
```
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;
int ternary_search(int a[], int l, int r, int key) {
	if (r >= l) {
		int mid1 = l + (r - l) / 3;
		int mid2 = r - (r - l) / 3;

		if (a[mid1] == key)  return mid1; //return if key is equal to mid1
		if (a[mid2] == key)  return mid2; // return if key is equal to mid2

		if (key < a[mid1]) {
			return ternary_search(a, l, mid1 - 1, key); //search in the first part
		}
		else if (key < a[mid2]) {
			return ternary_search(a, mid2 + 1, r, key); //search in the last part

		}
		else
		{
			return ternary_search(a, mid1 + 1, mid2 - 1, key); //search in the middle part
		}
	}

	return -1;  //if key not found
}

int main() {

	int n = 7;

	int a[] = {0, 2, 4, 9, 10, 14, 15};
	int l = 0, r = n - 1 ;
	int key1 = 24, key2 = 2;
	int p = ternary_search(a, l, r, key1); //index of key1
	int p1 = ternary_search(a, l, r, key2); // index of key2

	cout << endl;
	if (p == -1)
		cout << key1 << " is not present in the array." << endl;
	else
		cout << "key1 is found at INDEX : " << p << endl;

	cout << endl;

	if (p1 == -1)
		cout << key2 << " is not present in the array." << endl;
	else
		cout << key2 << " is found at the INDEX : " << p1 << endl;


	return 0;
}

**ITERATIVE APPROACH**
```
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;


int ternary_search(int a[],int l,int r,int key){
	while(r>=l){
		int mid1=l+(r-l)/3;
		int mid2=r-(r-l)/3;

		if(a[mid1]==key)  return mid1;  //return if key is equal to mid1
		if(a[mid2]==key)  return mid2;  // return if key is equal to mid2

		if(key<a[mid1]){
		r=mid1-1;       //search in the first part
		}
		else if(key<a[mid2]){
		l=mid2+1;         //search in the last part

		}
		else 
		{
	    l=mid1+1, r=mid2-1;  //search in the middle part
		}
	}

	return -1;  //if key not found
}

int main(){

	    int n=7;

		int a[]={0,2,4,9,10,14,15}; 
		int l=0,r=n-1 ;
		int key1=2,key2=10;
		int p=ternary_search(a,l,r,key1);  //position of key1
		int p1=ternary_search(a,l,r,key2); // positon of key2


if(p==-1) 
 cout<<key1<<" is not present in the array."<<endl;
else 
cout<<key1<<" is found at INDEX : "<<p<<endl;


if(p1==-1)
	cout<<key2<<" is not present in the array"<<endl;
else 
	cout<<key2<<" is found at INDEX : "<<p1<<endl;


return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity :
At each step, we are reducing the size of the searchable range by a constant factor (in this case 3). If you find your element after n steps, then the searchable range has size N = 3 raised to power n. Inversely, the number of steps that you need until you find the element is the logarithm of the size of the collection. That is, the runtime is O(log<sub>3</sub>N). A little further thought shows that you can also always construct situations where you need all those steps, so the worst-case runtime is actually O(log<sub>3</sub>N).

## Space Complexity:
O(1) as it is using constant space.Uusing the same array just changing the range of searching that is value of l,r.
