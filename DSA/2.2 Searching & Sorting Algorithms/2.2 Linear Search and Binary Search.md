# <p align="center">Linear Search and Binary Search</p>
### <p align="center"> What is Searching ? </p>
**Searching in data-strucutre refers to the process of finding a desired element in set of items. The desired element is called "target". The set of items to be searched in, can be any data-structure like − list, array, linked-list, tree or graph.**
## <p align="center"> Linear Search </p>
### Algorithm:-
**Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.**

**In the image shown above let our target element is 33 now we can start our searching from the start or from the end . Let we start our searching from start and compare element one by one if at any position any element found equal to  33 we will print element found and if we reach the last index and our target element is not found we will print not found.**

### Here is the implementation of Linear Search in C++
``` c++
  #include<bits/stdc++.h>
  using namespace std;
  int main()
  { 
      int n; cin>>n; 
      int arr[n];
      for( int i=0 ;i<n;i++)
       cin>>arr[i];
       bool flag=false;
       int target_element;  cin>>target_element;
       
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
       {
            if(arr[i]==target_element)
              {   
                  cout<<"element found";
                    flag=true;
                     break;
               }
        }
        if(!flag)      // if never arr[i]==target_elements condition holds true then flag will remain false it means element not found
        cout<<"element not found";
    }
 ```
### Time Complexity of Linear Search.

**Best Case :-**   The element being searched may be found at the first position.In this case, the search terminates in success with just one comparison.Thus in best case, linear search algorithm takes O(1) operations.

**Average and Worst Case :-**  In the worst possible case,The element being searched may be present at the last position or not present in the array at all.In the former case, the search terminates in success with n comparisons.In the later case, the search terminates in failure with n comparisons.Thus in worst case, linear search algorithm takes O(n) operations.

 ## <p align="center">Binary Search </p> 
 **Binary Search is one of the fastest searching algorithms.It is used for finding the location of an element in a linear array.It works on the principle of divide and conquer technique.**
 
 **Note Point :- Binary Search Algorithm can be applied only on Sorted arrays. So, the elements must be arranged in-**  
 **1. Either ascending order if the elements are numbers.**  
 
 **2. Or dictionary order if the elements are strings.**  
 
 ### Algorithm:-  
 
 **Binary Search Algorithm searches an element by comparing it with the middle most element of the array.** **Then, following three cases are possible-**  

**Case-01 :-  If the element being searched is found to be the middle most element, its index is returned.**  

**Case-02 :-  If the element being searched is found to be greater than the middle most element, then its search is further continued in the right sub array of the middle most element.**  

**Case-03 :- If the element being searched is found to be smaller than the middle most element, then its search is further continued in the left sub array of the middle most element. This iteration keeps on repeating on the sub arrays until the desired element is found or size of the sub array reduces to zero.**

### Here is the Recursive implementation of Binary Search In C++
```c++
 #include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

  int binarysearch(int arr[], int l ,int h,int target)
  {
        if(l<=h)
        {
              int mid = (l+h)/2;
            
              if(arr[mid]==target)
               return mid;
              if( arr[mid]>target)
                 h=mid-1;
              if( arr[mid]<target)
                   l=mid+1;
           return binarysearch(arr,l,h,target);   // recursive call 
        }
        return -1;   // target doesn't exist in the array
  }

int main()
{
     int n,target; cin>>n>>target; 
     int arr[n];
     for( int i=0;i<n;i++)
       cin>>arr[i];
     
     int ans =  binarysearch(arr,0,n-1,target);
     if(ans!=-1)
     cout<<"The element "<< target<<" found at index "<< ans<<endl;
     else
     cout<<"Element not found"<<endl;

} 
```
### Here is the Iterative implementation of Binary Search In C++

```c++
 #include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int binarySearch(int nums[], int n, int target)
{
    // search space is nums[low…high]
    int low = 0, high = n - 1;
 
    // loop till the search space is exhausted
    while (low <= high)
    {
        // find the mid-value in the search space and
        // compares it with the target
 
        int mid = (low + high)/2;    // overflow can happen
      
 
        // target value is found
        if (target == nums[mid]) {
            return mid;
        }
 
        // if the target is less than the middle element, discard all elements
        // in the right search space, including the middle element
        else if (target < nums[mid]) {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
 
        // if the target is more than the middle element, discard all elements
        // in the left search space, including the middle element
        else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
 
    // target doesn't exist in the array
    return -1;
}
 
int main(void)
{
    int nums[] = { 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 };
    int target = 5;
 
    int n = sizeof(nums)/sizeof(nums[0]);
    int index = binarySearch(nums, n, target);
 
    if (index != -1) {
        printf("Element found at index %d", index);
    }
    else {
        printf("Element not found in the array");
    }
 
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity of Binary Search.

**Case 1:- If the Array is already sorted then ,**  

  ****Best Case**** :-   **If the element being searched is found to be the middle most element, its index is returned. It will take O(1) time.**  
      
   ****Average and Worst Case**** :- **If the element being searched is found to be greater than the middle most element, then its search is further continued in the right sub           array of the middle most element.If the element being searched is found to be smaller than the middle most element,then its search is further continued in the left sub array of the middle most element. It will take O(logn) time.**


**Case 2:-  If the Array is not sorted then we have to  first sort the array which can be done in O(nlogn) time by choosing best sorting algorithm. Now Our Best case and worst case is same as Case 1**
        
## <p align="center"> Difference between Linear Search and Binary Search.</p>
| Linear Search | Binary Search |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|It can be applicable on both sorted and unsorted array | It can be applicable on Sorted Array |
| The linear search starts searching from the first element and compares each element with a searched element till the element is not found. | It finds the position of the searched element by finding the middle element of the array. |
| 	In a linear search, the elements don't need to be arranged in sorted order. | The pre-condition for the binary search is that the elements must be arranged in a sorted order. |
| The linear search can be implemented on any linear data structure such as an array, linked list, etc. | The implementation of binary search is limited as it can be implemented only on those data structures that have two-way traversal.|
|It is less efficient in the case of large-size data sets.| It is more efficient in the case of large-size data sets.|
|In a linear search, the worst- case scenario for finding the element is O(n)|In a binary search, the worst-case scenario for finding the element is O(log2n).|
|In a linear search, the best-case scenario for finding the first element in the list is O(1).|In a binary search, the best-case scenario for finding the first element in the list is O(1).|
