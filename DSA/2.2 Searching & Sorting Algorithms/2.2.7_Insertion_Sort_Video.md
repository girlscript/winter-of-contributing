## What is Insertion Sort ?

Insertion sort is the sorting mechanism where the sorted array is built having one item at a time. 
The array elements are compared with each other sequentially and then arranged simultaneously in some particular order. 

The analogy can be understood from the style we arrange a deck of cards. This sort works on the principle of inserting an element at a particular position, hence the name Insertion Sort.
