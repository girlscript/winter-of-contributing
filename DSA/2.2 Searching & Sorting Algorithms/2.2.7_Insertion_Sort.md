## Insertion Sort

### Intuition

**Insertion sort** is a comparatively simple and intuitive sorting algorithm.

Think back to the time when you arranged cards in your hand while playing! 
- We keep a sorted collection in one hand. 
- When we pick any new card we decide its appropriate position according to its value. 
- We then **insert** it in that position, thus updating our sorted collection correctly.

Insertion sort works similar to this and gets its name from the action of **insertion**.

### How to sort elements in an array using insertion sort ?

Steps involved in insertion sort :
- We consider that the first element is **already sorted** (an array of size 1 is always sorted), and we **start sorting with the next element.**
- We **compare** this element with the elements in the **sorted sub-array**, that is the array being maintained to the left of the selected element.
- We **shift** all the elements which are **greater than our currently selected element** by one position to the right, thus creating a **vacancy.**
- We **insert** the selected element at the vacant position.
- We **repeat** this process until the array is sorted.

Consider an unsorted array :
> 5 2 4 6 1 3
- 5 is sorted. Select 2.
- 5 > 2 so shift 5.
- Insert 2.
> 2 5 4 6 1 3
- [2,5] is sorted. Select 4.
- 5 > 4 so shift 5.
- 2 < 4 so no shifting required.
- Insert 4.
> 2 4 5 6 1 3
- [2,4,5] is sorted. Select 6.
- 5 < 6 so no shifting required.
- Insert 6.
> 2 4 5 6 1 3
- [2,4,5,6] is sorted. Select 1.
- 6>1, 5>1, 4>1, 2>1 so shift 6, 5, 4, 2.
- Insert 1.
> 1 2 4 5 6 3
- [1,2,4,5,6] is sorted. Select 3.
- 6>3, 5>3, 4>3 so shift 6, 5 , 4.
- 2<3 so no shifting required.
- Insert 3.
> 1 2 3 4 5 6
- Array is sorted.

### Pseudo code for insertion sort

Based on the above steps we can give the pseudo code as :
```
function insertion_sort(array) :
    FOR every index i in array
        selected = array[i]
        j = i-1
        WHILE j >= 0 AND array[j] > selected
            array[j+1] = array[j]
            j = j-1
        array[j+1] = selected
```
In the insertion_sort() function
- We iterate through the input array and select the next unsorted element in each iteration. 
- Then we iterate through the sorted sub-array being maintained in the left. We compare elements and within the bounds if we get the condition that the element in sorted sub-array is greater than selected element then we enter the while loop and shift them accordingly. 
- We exit the while loop either if we finish iterating through the sorted sub-array or we reach an element which is not greater than our selected element. 
- In this correct position we insert the selected element and then proceed to repeat the process for the next unsorted element in the array.
### Code for insertion sort

Let's see how to implement the given pseudo code in C++.
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void insertion_sort(int arr[], int n)
{
    int i,j,selected;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        //selecting the unsorted element
        selected = arr[i];
        //initializing j as the last index of the sorted sub-array
        j = i-1;
        //iterating through the sorted sub-array and comparing the elements
        while(j >= 0 && arr[j] > selected)
        {
            //shifting one position towards right
            arr[j+1] = arr[j];
            j = j-1;
        }
        //inserting the selected element in the correct position
        arr[j+1] = selected;
    }
    //displaying the sorted array
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
}

int main()
{
    int i,n;
    //taking size of array and array values as input
    cin>>n;
    int arr[n];
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        cin>>arr[i];
    //calling the sorting function
    insertion_sort(arr,n);
}
```
### Analysis of insertion sort algorithm

**Time Complexity**
<br>
<br>
**Worst Case - O(n^2)**
<br>
If the array to be sorted is sorted in reverse order
<br>
In this scenario for element at index n-1 we will enter the while loop n-1 times, for index n-2 we will enter n-2 times and so on. We perform 2 primitive operations in the while loop each time.
So total number of operations will be given as
<br>
2 * (1 + 2 + .... + n-2 + n-1 )
<br>
= 2 * ((n-1)(n-1+1)) / 2
<br>
= (n-1)(n)
<br>
= n^2 - n
<br>
Thus time complexity will be given by O(n^2).
<br>
<br>
**Best Case - O(n)**
<br>
If the array is already sorted
<br>
In this scenario we will never enter the while loop and thus we will simply iterate through the given array once thus giving time complexity as O(n)
<br>
<br>
**Average Case - O(n^2)**
<br>
It is calculated similar to the worst case calculation.

**Space Complexity**
<br>
The algorithm uses constant space thus space complexity of algorithm will be **O(1)**

### Insertion sort for nearly sorted arrays

**Nearly sorted array** is an array in which each element is at most k positions away from its final position.
In this case each element will be O(k) positions shifted at most thus giving time complexity **O(nk).**
<br>
If k is sufficiently smaller than n then time complexity is improved significantly.

### Properties of insertion sort algorithm

- It is a **stable** algorithm.
- It is an **adaptive** algorithm.
- It is an **internal** algorithm.
- For small array size, insertion sort is preferred.
- For nearly sorted arrays, insertion sort is preferred.
