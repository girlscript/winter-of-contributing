# **Stability in Sorting Algorithms**

## **Description:**
     In this video we discuss
     * What do you mean by stability in sorting algorithms? 
     * Which sorting algorithms are unstable? 
     * Give examples. How can you make them stable?

## **Introduction:**
    Merge sort is considered the best algorithm even though it has same time complexity as quick sort i.e. O(n(logn)).
    This is because merge sort is stable, while quick sort is not.
    This video explains everything about stability of the sorting algorithms.
