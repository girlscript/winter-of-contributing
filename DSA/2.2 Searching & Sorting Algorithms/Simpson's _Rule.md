## What is Simpson's Rule  :triangular_ruler:

- Simpson's rule is a method for numerical integration. In other words, it's the numerical approximation of definite integrals.
- This method is named after the English mathematician Thomas Simpson 
- Simpson's Rule is based on the fact that given three points, we can find the equation of a quadratic through those points.

## Two types of Simpson's Rule :two:
1. **Simpson's 1/3 Rule**
2. **Simpson's 3/8 Rule**

&nbsp;
## Difference between Simpson's 3/8 and Simpson's 1/3 Rule 
>Simpson's 3/8 rule is similar to Simpson's 1/3 rule, the only difference is , for the 3/8 rule, the interpolant is a cubic polynomial. Though the 3/8 rule uses one more function value, it is about twice as accurate as the 1/3 rule.

## Solving Logic of Simpson's Rule :brain:

 >To obtain an approximation of the definite integral   **\int\limits_a^b {f\left( x \right)dx}** using Simpson's Rule, we partition the interval [a,b] into an even number  of n subintervals, each of width   **\Delta x = \frac{{b - a}}{n}**.

>- f(x) is called the integrand
>- a = lower limit of integration
>- b = upper limit of integration

&nbsp;

## Algorithm for simpson's 1/3 rule :arrow_double_down:

1. Start

2. Define function f(x)

3. Read lower limit of integration, upper limit of 
   integration and number of sub interval

4. Calcultae: step size = (upper limit - lower limit)/number of sub interval

5. Set: integration value = f(lower limit) + f(upper limit)

6. Set: i = 1

7. If i > number of sub interval then goto 

8. Calculate: k = lower limit + i * h

9. If i mod 2 =0 then 
     Integration value = Integration Value + 2* f(k)
   Otherwise
     Integration Value = Integration Value + 4 * f(k)
   End If

10. Increment i by 1 i.e. i = i+1 and go to step 7

11. Calculate: Integration value = Integration value * step size/3 

12. Display Integration value as required answer

13. Stop

## Code for Simpson's Rule

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<math.h>

/* Define function here */
#define f(x) 1/(1+pow(x,2))

using namespace std;
int main()
{
 float lower, upper, integration=0.0, stepSize, k;
 int i, subInterval;

 /* Input */
 cout<<"Enter lower limit of integration: ";
 cin>>lower;
 cout<<"Enter upper limit of integration: ";
 cin>>upper;
 cout<<"Enter number of sub intervals: ";
 cin>>subInterval;

 /* Calculation */

 /* Finding step size */
 stepSize = (upper - lower)/subInterval;

 /* Finding Integration Value */
 integration = f(lower) + f(upper);

 for(i=1; i<= subInterval-1; i++)
 {
  k = lower + i*stepSize;
  // This will ensure if given number is even 
  if(i%2==0)
  {
    integration = integration + 2 * (f(k));
  }
  else
  {
    integration = integration + 4 * (f(k));
  }

 }

 integration = integration * stepSize/3;
 // printing the value after integration
 cout<< endl <<"Required value of integration is: "<< integration;

 return 0;
}
```

## SOLUTION

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;

float f(float x)
{
	return x*sin(x);	//Define the function f(x)
}

float simpson(float a, float b, int n)
{
	float h, x[n+1], sum = 0;
	int j;
	h = (b-a)/n;
	
	x[0] = a;
	
	for(j=1; j<=n; j++)
	{
		x[j] = a + h*j;
	}
	
	for(j=1; j<=n/2; j++)
	{
		sum += f(x[2*j - 2]) + 4*f(x[2*j - 1]) + f(x[2*j]);
	}
	
	return sum*h/3;
}

int main()
{
	float a,b,n;
	a = 1;		//Enter lower limit a
	b = 4;		//Enter upper limit b
	n = 8;		//Enter step-length n
	if (n%2 == 0)
		cout<<simpson(a,b,n)<<endl;
	else
		cout<<"n should be an even number";
	return 0;
}
```

## Time complexity of Simpson's Rule :clock1230:

**Time complexity for This Rule is = O(n)** 
<hr>
because more terms for f(x0), f(xn). The number of terms used for the Simpson rule for a given n is linear to n. Assuming multiplication is constant and the function complexity is constant, we note the summation formula i.e From the summation term **âˆ‘k=2(n-1)/2** , we can easily state that there are **[(n-1)/2 - 2 + 1]** terms to determine that the time complexity of the Simpson rule is O(n), it runs in linear time.
