# Searching:

Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored. 
This is the process by which one searches the group of elements for the desired element. 
Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, either with discrete or continuous values.
There are different methods of searching but let us deal two popular methods of searching and they are linear search and binary search.

The most common searching algorithms are:

|Search Algorithm | Time Complexity
| --- | --- |
|1. Linear search | O(n)
| 2. Binary search | O(log(n))
|3. Interpolation search | O(n)
|4. Exponential search | O(log(n))

# Sorting:

This is the operation of arranging the elements of a table into some sequential order according to ordering criteria. 
The sort is performed according to the key value of each of the elements. 
Depending on the structure of the key, elements can be sorted numerically, alphabetically or alphanumerically. 
For example in numerical sorting, the elements are arranged in ascending or descending order according to the numerical value of each of the elements.

    Importance of sorting:

        1. To represent data in more readable format.
        2. Optimize data searching to high level.

The most common sorting algorithms are:
    
   |No.|Algorithm|Best|Average|Worst 
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   |1.| Selection Sort|Ω(n^2)|θ(n^2)|O(n^2)	 
   |2.|Bubble Sort|Ω(n)|θ(n^2)|O(n^2)	 
   |3.| Insertion Sort|Ω(n)|θ(n^2)|O(n^2)	 
   |4.| Heap Sort|Ω(n log(n))|θ(n log(n))|O(n log(n))	 
   |5.| Quick Sort|Ω(n log(n))|θ(n log(n))|O(n^2)	 
   |6.| Merge Sort|Ω(n log(n))|θ(n log(n))|O(n log(n))	 
   |7.| Bucket Sort|Ω(n+k)|θ(n+k)|O(n^2)	 
   |8.| Radix Sort|Ω(nk)|θ(nk)|O(nk)	 
  
Selection Sort	Ω(n^2)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)

# Difference between Searching and Sorting Algorithm:
 
| S.No. |	Searching Algorithm	| Sorting Algorithm
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |	Searching Algorithms are designed to retrieve an element from any data structure where it is used. |	A Sorting Algorithm is used to arranging the data of list or array into some specific order.
| 2 |	These algorithms are generally classified into two categories i.e. Sequential Search and Interval Search.	| There are two different categories in sorting. These are Internal and External Sorting.
| 3	| The worst-case time complexity of searching algorithm is O(N).	| The worst-case time complexity of many sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort is O(N2).
| 4	| There is no stable and unstable searching algorithms. |	Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort etc are the stable sorting algorithms whereas Quick Sort, Heap Sort etc are the unstable sorting algorithms.
| 5 | The Linear Search and the Binary Search are the examples of Searching Algorithms. |	The Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort etc are the examples of Sorting Algorithms.
