# Bisection Method (Binary Search)
The <i>Bisection method</i> is a numerical method to find a <b>root</b> of any <b>continuous</b> real valued function of which one knows two values of the function with opposite signs. Here root of a function *f* means a value *x* such that *f(x) = 0*. It is a successive approximation method to find a root which narrows down an interval that contains a root of the function *f*. An initial interval *[a, b]* is provided where *a < b* and *f(a)f(b) < 0*.

## A mathematical theorem

If a real valued function *f(x)* is continuous on the interval *[a, b]* and sign of *f(a)* ≠ sign of *f(b)*, then there exists atleast one value *c ∈ [a,b]* such that *f(c) = 0*. That is, there is atleast one root *c* of the function *f* in the interval *[a,b]*.

## Analysis of the Bisection method

From the theorem it is clear that the root must lie inside the interval *[a,b]*. At each step the method divides the interval in two halves by computing the midpoint *c = (a+b)/2* of the interval and the value of the function *f(c)* at that point. If *c* is itself a root (which is very unlikely, but obviously possible) then we are done, else there are now only two possibilities : either *f(a)* and *f(c)* have opposite signs and thus contains a root inside the interval *[a,c]*, or *f(c)* and *f(b)* have opposite signs and contains a root inside the interval *[b,c]*. The method now selects the subinterval that is guaranteed to contain a root as the new interval to be used in the next step. In this way an interval that contains a root of *f* is reduced in width by 50% at each step. The process is continued until the interval is sufficiently small.<br>

If *f(a)* and *f(c)* have opposite signs, then the bisection method sets *c* as the new value for *b*, else if *f(b)* and *f(c)* have opposite signs then the method sets *c* as the new value for *a*. If *f(c)=0* then *c* is taken as the solution and the process stops else we continue this process until we get a value which is approximately equal to the actual value of the root. In both cases as the new *f(a)* and *f(b)* have opposite signs, so the method is applicable to the smaller intervals too.<br>

It is a very simple and robust method, but it is also relatively slow. Because of this, it is often used to obtain a rough approximation to a solution which is then used as a starting point for more rapidly converging methods.

## Pseudocode
We can deploy the bisection method using the same technique as we deploy binary search. This method can be implemented using both by iterative approach and recursive approach.


INPUT: Function f, endpoint values a, b, and tolerance error <br>
CONDITIONS: *a < b*, either *f(a) < 0* and *f(b) > 0* or *f(a) > 0* and *f(b) < 0* <br>
OUTPUT: value which differs from a root of *f(x) = 0* by less than error <br>

TIME COMPLEXITY : O(log(n)) <br>
SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1) <br>
where *n = (b-a)* the length of the initial interval

## Python sample code for Bisection method

### Iterative implementation
``` python
def f(x):
    return x**3+x**2-4

def iterativeBisection(a, b, error):
    while (b-a) >= error:
        c = (a+b) / 2
        if f(c)==0:
            break
        else:
            if f(a) * f(c) < 0:
                b = c
            else:
                a = c
    return c 
print(iterativeBisection(1, 2, 0.001))
```

### Recursive implementation
``` python
def f(x):
    return x**3+x**2-4

def recursiveBisection(a, b, error):
    c = (a+b) / 2 
    if (b-a) >= error:
        if f(c) == 0:
            return c
        else:
            if f(a) * f(c) < 0:
                return recursiveBisection(a, c, error)
            else:
                return recursiveBisection(c, b, error)
    return c
print(recursiveBisection(1, 2, 0.001))
```
