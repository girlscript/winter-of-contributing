## Implementation of string in Java
<hr>
String is a sequence of characters. In java, objects of String are immutable which means a constant and cannot be changed once created.

### Creating a String:
  There are two ways to create string in Java:
  
    1. String literal
    
      String s = “Winter-of-contributing”;
      
    2. Using new keyword
    
      String s = new String ("Winter-of-contributing”);
      
      
The String class represents character strings. All string literals in Java programs, such as "abc", are implemented as instances of this class.

Strings are constant; their values cannot be changed after they are created. String buffers support mutable strings. Because String objects are immutable they can be shared. For example:

     String str = "abc";
 
is equivalent to:

     char data[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
     String str = new String(data);
 
Here are some more examples of how strings can be used:

     System.out.println("abc");
     String cde = "cde";
     System.out.println("abc" + cde);
     String c = "abc".substring(2,3);
     String d = cde.substring(1, 2);
 
The class String includes methods for examining individual characters of the sequence, for comparing strings, for searching strings, for extracting substrings, and for creating a copy of a string with all characters translated to uppercase or to lowercase. Case mapping is based on the Unicode Standard version specified by the Character class.

The Java language provides special support for the string concatenation operator ( + ), and for conversion of other objects to strings. String concatenation is implemented through the StringBuilder(or StringBuffer) class and its append method. String conversions are implemented through the method toString, defined by Object and inherited by all classes in Java. For additional information on string concatenation and conversion, see Gosling, Joy, and Steele, The Java Language Specification.

Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or method in this class will cause a NullPointerException to be thrown.

### String Length:

Methods used to obtain information about an object are known as accessor methods. One accessor method that you can use with strings is the length() method, which returns the number of characters contained in the string object.

The following program is an example of length(), method String class.

Example:

  public class StringDemo {

     public static void main(String args[]) {
        String palindrome = "Dot saw I was Tod";
        int len = palindrome.length();
        System.out.println( "String Length is : " + len );
     }
  }


This will produce the following result −

Output:

  String Length is : 17
  
  
The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. If there is a necessity to make a lot of modifications to Strings of characters, then you should use String Buffer & String Builder Classes.

### StringBuffer Class:

Java StringBuffer class is used to create mutable (modifiable) String objects. The StringBuffer class in Java is the same as String class except it is mutable i.e. it can be changed.

StringBuffer():	It creates an empty String buffer with the initial capacity of 16.

StringBuffer(String str):	It creates a String buffer with the specified string.

StringBuffer(int capacity):	It creates an empty String buffer with the specified capacity as length.

### StringBuilder Class:

Java StringBuilder class is used to create mutable (modifiable) String. The Java StringBuilder class is same as StringBuffer class except that it is non-synchronized. It is available since JDK 1.5.

StringBuilder():	It creates an empty String Builder with the initial capacity of 16.

StringBuilder(String str):	It creates a String Builder with the specified string.

StringBuilder(int length):	It creates an empty String Builder with the specified capacity as length.
