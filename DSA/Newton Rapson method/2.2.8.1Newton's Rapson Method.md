# Newton's Rapson method

## Introduction:
*  Newton's Rapson method is classified under equations which finds roots for algebraic and transcendental equations.
* Some other methods under this category are: 
 * Bisection method
 * Regular Faisi 
 * Secant method 
 * Iteration Method.
* This method exact root which quadratic convergence rate. 
* We get solution with lesser number of iterations.
* Easiest and fastest convergence method compare to other.


## Formula and Procedure

* We need to get points x1, x2, x0 such that f(x1)*f(x2) = 0 and x0 is any point between x1 and x2

* x0 can be achieved by : x0 = (x1+x2)/2

* we take a tangent to line. 
* tangent formula: y = f(x) = dy/dx(x-x0)
* This tangent cuts the x-axis at (x1,0)
* Now the equaion of tangent become: 
0-f(x0)-f'(x0)(x1-x0)

x1-x0 = -f(x0)/f'(x0)

x1 = x0-f(x0)/f'(x0)

In general we can write above equation as:

x(n+1) = xn-f(xn)/f'(xn), 

where f'(xn) is non zero.


* example: 
 * Find the root of following equation: f(x)=x^3-x-1 = 0 till 4 correct decimal places.

  * solution: 

    find x1,x2   where f(x1)*f(x2)=0

    f(x) = 3x^2-1

    f(1) = -1<0 andf(2) = 5>0

    Therefore root lies between 1 and 2.
         
    lets take x1 = 1 and x2 = 2
    find value of x0: (1+2)/2 = 1.5

    find x1,x2,x3.....
    
    x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x1) 
       
    = 1.5-(0.875/5.75)
    
    = 1.3478

    x2 = x1 - f(x2)/f'(x2)
    
    = 1.3478-(0.10068/4.44991)
   
    = 1.3252

repeat the steps until we get approximate value.

 After 2 more iterations we get x4 = 1.32472 which is approximate and our root value.    

## Program explanation:

Declare variables for storing x value provided by user, variable which contain root, to store final value of functions and value of derivative

Find value of points x1 and x2

Iterate the loop till maximum, to reach root

```

#define f(x) 3*x-cos(x)-1
#define g(x) 3+sin(x)
int main()
{
float x0 , x1, f0, f1, df0;
int count = 0;
printf("enter value of x0");
scanf("%f",&x0);
do
{
f0 = f(x0); // to store function value
g0=g(x0); // to store value of df
if(f0==0.0)
{
printf("Math error");
exit(0);
}

x1 = x0-(f0)/(g0);
f1 = f(x1);
x0 = x1;
count++;
printf("No of iterations = %d\n root obtained = %d\n f(x) = %d",count,x1,f1);
}
while(fabs(f1)>e);
printf("Root is:%f",x1);
return 0;
}

```

Disadvantage of Newton's Rapson method:
* It may not work if there are points of inflection, local maxima or minima around root.
