# Longest common subsequence in the 2 given sequences
---
In order to find out the complexity of brute force approach, we need to first know the number of possible different subsequences of a string with length n,
i.e., find the number of subsequences with lengths ranging from 1,2,..n-1. Recall from theory of permutation and combination that number of combinations with 1 element are nC1. 
Number of combinations with 2 elements are nC2 and so forth and so on. We know that nC0 + nC1 + nC2 + … nCn = 2n. 
So a string of length n has 2n-1 different possible subsequences since we do not consider the subsequence with length 0. 
This implies that the time complexity of the brute force approach will be O(n * 2n). Note that it takes O(n) time to check if a subsequence is common to both the strings.
This time complexity can be improved using dynamic programming.
It is a classic computer science problem, the basis of diff (a file comparison program that outputs the differences between two files), and has applications in bioinformatics.
The naive solution for this problem is to generate all subsequences of both given sequences and find the longest matching subsequence. 
> **This solution is exponential in term of time complexity. Let us see how this problem possesses both important properties of a Dynamic Programming (DP) Problem.**
**1) Optimal Substructure:** 
Let the input sequences be `X[0..m-1] and Y[0..n-1] of lengths m and n respectively. And let L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) be the length of LCS of the two sequences X and Y.
Following is the recursive definition of L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]).`
If last characters of both sequences match (or X[m-1] == Y[n-1]) then 
L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = 1 + L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-2])
If last characters of both sequences do not match (or X[m-1] != Y[n-1]) then 
L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = MAX ( L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-1]), L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-2]) )

## Examples: 
> 1) Consider the input strings “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB”. Last characters match for the strings. So length of LCS can be written as: 
L(“AGGTAB”, “GXTXAYB”) = 1 + L(“AGGTA”, “GXTXAY”)

> 2) Consider the input strings “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR. Last characters do not match for the strings. So length of LCS can be written as: 
L(“ABCDGH”, “AEDFHR”) = MAX ( L(“ABCDG”, “AEDFHR”), L(“ABCDGH”, “AEDFH”) )
So the LCS problem has optimal substructure property as the main problem can be solved using solutions to subproblems.
**2) Overlapping Subproblems:**
Following is simple recursive implementation of the LCS problem. The implementation simply follows the recursive structure mentioned above.

	return 0;

	return 1 + lcs(X, Y, m-1, n-1);

	int n = Y.length;

	System.out.println("Length of LCS is" + " " +
								lcs.lcs( X, Y, m, n ) );

**Time complexity of the above naive recursive approach is O(2^n) in worst case and worst case happens when all characters of X and Y mismatch i.e., length of LCS is 0.**
