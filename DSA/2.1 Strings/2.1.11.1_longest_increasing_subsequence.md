# Longest Increasing Subsequence in Array

In this concept, Consider that We have an Array with n numbers . Our task is to find the Longest, Strictly Increasing, Subsequence in the given Array.

Subsequence is the sequence not necessarily continuous but in increasing index number.

Sample Case ; A[n] = {1,2,3,5,7,11,4,6,8,9}
In this case the increasing subsequencies possible are {1,2,3,5,7,11}, {1,2,3,5,7,8,9} and {1,2,3,4,6,8}Among these two best possible sequences the second sequence is longer and has more number of elements. So, That is our expected sequence and its length is 7. And that is our answer.

Let's check the strategy for all possible cases that we can face.

1. If the current element is smaller than the smallest element at that time in the Longest Increasing subsequence then we will start the new sequence and count it from 1.

1. If the  current element is largest than the largest element at that time in the Longest Increasing subsequence then we will copy the Longest Sequence we found till then and add this element to that subsequence.

1. If the  current element is in between the largest and smallest elements at that time in the Longest Increasing subsequence then we will copy the Longest Sequence we found till then and replace this element to that subsequence and also delete the other subsequences of same length.

**Let's Dry Run our Program with the given above example.**

```
A[0]  = 1 --> Case 1
Subsequence : 1
---
A[1] = 2 --> Case 2
Subsequence : 1 , 2
---
A[2] = 3 --> Case 2
Subsequence : 1 , 2 , 3
---
A[3] = 5 --> Case 2
Subsequence : 1 , 2 , 3 , 5
---
A[4] = 7 --> Case 2
Subsequence : 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7
---
A[5] = 11 --> Case 2
Subsequence : 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11
---
A[6] = 4 --> Case 1
Subsequence : 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11
Subsequence : {1,2,3},4 -> 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8
---
A[7] = 6 --> Case 2
Subsequence : 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11
Subsequence : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6
--- 
A[7] = 8 --> Case 3
Subsequence : 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11  (Delete this)
Subsequence : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8
Subsequence : 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 8
--- 
A[7] = 9 --> Case 2
Subsequence : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8
Subsequence : 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9
```

Algorithm :

Knowing length of longest subsequence is easy. We are dealing with end elements only. We need not to maintain all the Subsequences. We can store the end elements in an array. Deleting operation can be simulated with replacement, and extending a subsequence is analogous to adding more elements to array.

We will use an auxiliary array to keep end elements. The maximum length of this array is that of input. In the worst case the array divided into N subsequences of size one. To discard an element, we will trace upper value of A[i] in auxiliary array (again observe the end elements in your rough work), and replace upper value with A[i]. We extend a list by adding element to auxiliary array. We also maintain a counter to keep track of auxiliary array length.


```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to find length of longest increasing subsequence
int LIS(int arr[], int i, int n, int prev)
{
	// Base case: if nothing is remaining
	if (i == n)
		return 0;

	// case 1: exclude the current element and process the
	// remaining elements
	int exclude = LIS(arr, i + 1, n, prev);

	// case 2: include the current element if it is greater
	// than previous element in LIS
	int include = 0;
	if (arr[i] > prev)
		include = 1 + LIS(arr, i + 1, n, arr[i]);

	// return maximum of above two choices
	return max(include, exclude);
}

// main function
int main()
{
   int n;
   cout<<"Enter the number of Array elements : ";
   cin>>n;
	int arr[n];
   cout<<"Enter the elements of the Array : ";
	for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
      cin>>arr[i];
   }
	cout << "Length of the longest increasing subsequence is :" 
	<< LIS(arr, 0, n, -1)<<"\n";
	return 0;
}
```
```
Sample Input : 
    10
    1 2 3 5 7 11 4 6 8 9
Sample Output : 
    Length of the longest increasing subsequence is : 7
```
```

Time Complexity : O(N log(N))

The loop runs for N elements. In the worst case, we may end up querying value using binary search (log i) for many A[i].
Therefore,O(N log N).
