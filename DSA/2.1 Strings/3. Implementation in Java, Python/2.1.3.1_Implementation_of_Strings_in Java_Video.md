## What is Strings ?

String is a sequence of characters. In java, objects of String are immutable which means a constant and cannot be changed once created.

### Creating a String:

There are two ways to create string in Java:
1. String Literal

```
  String s = “Winter-of-contributing”;
```

2. Using new keyword

```
  String s = new String ("Winter-of-contributing”);
```  
  
### String Length:

Methods used to obtain information about an object are known as accessor methods. One accessor method that you can use with strings is the length() method, which returns the number of characters contained in the string object.

The following program is an example of length(), method String class.

Example:

```
  public class StringDemo {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
        String palindrome = "Dot saw I was Tod";
        int len = palindrome.length();
        System.out.println( "String Length is : " + len );
     }
  }
```  

This will produce the following result −

**Output:**

String Length is : 17

The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. If there is a necessity to make a lot of modifications to Strings of characters, then you should use String Buffer & String Builder Classes.
