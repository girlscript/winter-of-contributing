# String Anagram Problem 3
##  üí° Problem statement: 
#### Given two strings s1 and s2, the task is to find the minimum number of steps required to convert s1 into s2. The only operation allowed is to swap adjacent elements in the first string. Every swap is counted as a single step.
## Examples: 
1) Input : s1='abcd' and s2='cdab'
Output : Minimum 4 swaps are required 
#### Explanation:
##### Swap 2nd and 3rd element, abcd => acbd 
##### Swap 1st and 2nd element, acbd => cabd 
##### Swap 3rd and 4th element, cabd => cadb 
##### Swap 2nd and 3rd element, cadb => cdab 


2) Input: 
noon 
Output: 0 
Explanation: No anagram of the word 'noon' is present in the input text.

3) Input: plant 
tlnap 
Output: 1 
Explanation: The entire word is an anagram of the given text.
***
## Approach:
- Firstly Check if the two strings are Anagram of each other. Then only they can be made equal
- We will use the ```two pointer ```technique for solving this problem efficiently.
- Use two pointers i and j for first and second strings respectively. Initialise i and j to 0. 
- Iterate over the first string and find the position j such that s1[j] = s2[i] by incrementing the value to j
- Keep on swapping the adjacent elements j and j ‚Äì 1 and decrement j until it is greater than i. 
- Now the ith element of the first string is equal to the second string, hence increment the value of i. 

## üë©‚Äçüíª Code:


C++ implementation 

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function that returns true if s1
// and s2 are anagrams of each other
bool isAnagram(string s1, string s2)
{
	sort(s1.begin(), s1.end());
	sort(s2.begin(), s2.end());
	if (s1 == s2)
		return 1;
	return 0;
}

// Function to return the minimum swaps required
int minSwap(string s1, string s2, int n)
{
	int i = 0, j = 0;
	int swap = 0;

	// Iterate over the first string and convert
	// every element equal to the second string
	while (i < size) {
		j = i;

		// Find index element of first string which
		// is equal to the ith element of second string
		while (s1[j] != s2[i]) {
			j += 1;
		}

		// Swap adjacent elements in first string so
		// that element at ith position becomes equal
		while (i < j) {

			// Swap elements using temporary variable
			char temp = s1[j];
			s1[j] = s1[j - 1];
			s1[j - 1] = temp;
			j -= 1;
			swap += 1;
		}
		i += 1;
	}
	return swap;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	string s1 = "abcd";
	string s2 = "cdab";

	int n = s2.size();

	/* If both the strings are anagrams
	 of each other then only they
	 can be made equal */
	if (isAnagram(s1, s2))
		cout <<"Minimum swaps required: "<<minSwap(s1, s2, size);
	else
		cout << -1;

	return 0;
}

```

### Output:
``` 
Minimum swaps required: 4 
```
  

## üìä Analysis: üìà
- The **time complexity** of the above algorithm is ```O(Nlogn + N')``` where N' is the lengths of the string 2.
- The **space complexity** is ```O(N)``` due to sorting of the strings , checking if they are anagrams.
