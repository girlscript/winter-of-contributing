# Strings Anagram

## Introduction:
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
typically using all the original letters exactly once. The anagram of a string may or may not be meaningful.

## Example:
A common example is listen & silent

Other examples can be:  

cat & tac  
friend & dneirf

## Method 1:
In this method we first sort the strings and then compare the characters one by one.

Time Complexity - O(N LogN)  
Space Complexity - O(N)

## Mehod 2:
* In this method we count the frequency of the characters.  
* Maintain them in 2 seperate arrays.
* Compare the frequency of characters one by one.

Time Complexity - O(N)  
Space Complexity - O(N)

Now, let us see the code in C++:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// In this method we first sort both the strings and then compare each character one by one.
int method_1(string s1, string s2)
{
    // If length of both strings is not same, then they cannot be anagram of each other
    if (s1.length() != s2.length())
    {
        return 0;
    }

    // Sort both the strings
    sort(s1.begin(), s1.end());
    sort(s2.begin(), s2.end());

    // Compare sorted strings
    for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++)
    {
        if (s1[i] != s2[i])
            return 0;
    }

    return 1;
}

// In this method we will count the frequeny of characters and then compare.
int method_2(string s1, string s2)
{
    int a1[26] = {0}, a2[26] = {0};

    // If string lengths are different then they are not anagrams
    if (s1.length() != s2.length())
    {
        return 0;
    }

    // We will count the frequency of char in both strings
    for (int i = 0; s1[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
        a1[s1[i] - 'a']++;
    }

    for (int i = 0; s2[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
        a2[s2[i] - 'a']++;
    }

    // Compare frequencies
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
    {
        if (a1[i] != a2[i])
            return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}

int main()
{
    //we will use the 2 strings and check whether they are anagram of each other or not
    string s1, s2;
    cout << "Enter 2 strings \n"
         << "P.s. Strings are case sensitive" << endl;
    cin >> s1 >> s2;

    cout << "Using Method 1: \n";
    if (method_1(s1, s2))
    {
        cout << "Strings are anagram of each other \n";
    }
    else
        cout << "Not anagrams of each other \n";

    cout << "Using Method 2: \n";
    if (method_2(s1, s2))
    {
        cout << "Strings are anagram of each other \n";
    }
    else
        cout << "Not anagrams of each other \n";
}
```
