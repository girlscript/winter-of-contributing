# __Given a binary string S, find the maximum length of substrings required to be flipped repeatedly to make all the characters of a binary string equal to ‘0’.__

### Description

You are given binary string that is, ___a string made up with character '1' & '0'only___. You have to find the maximum length of substring required to be flipped repeatedly to make all the character of binary string equal to the character ___'0'___.  

#### Example 1:

string = "010"

let k = 3,
fliping string[0,2] => "101"

let k = 2,
flipping string[0,1] => "011"
flipping string[1,2] => "000"

hence our ans is ___'2'.___

#### Example 2:

string = "10101"

let k = 5,
fliping string[0,4] => "01010"

let k = 4,
flipping string[0,3] => "10100"
flipping string[1,4] => "11011"

let k = 3,
flipping string[2,4] => "11100"
flipping string[0,2] => "00000"

hence our ans is ___'3'.___


#### Approach

- Firstly, we initialize  "__ans__" variable as the size of the string. 
- Then we start  traversing the string. While traversing, we check whether two adjacent character are different or not. 
- If they are different then we take the maximum of the left substring (LHS) or the right substring (RHS). i.e maximum = max(LHS, RHS)
- Then we equate our __ans__ to minimum of ans or the maximum of previous. i.e ans = min(ans, maximum)
- We repeat this until we reach the end of the string.

#### Code

```python
def solve(string):
	Length = len(string)
	# initialize ans to length of the string
	ans = Length
    # Base case check: when the whole string is made up of '0' or '1'
	check = 0
	for i in range(0,Length-1):
	
		if (string[i] != string[i + 1]):
		
			# Base case check: since the characters are different so base case is not required
			flag = 1
			
			# Finding the maximum of LHS & RHS
			maximum =  max(i + 1,N - i - 1)
			
			#Taking the min of 'ans' & 'maximum'
			ans = min(ans, maximum)
	# Handling the base case
	if (flag == 0):
		if(string[0] == '0'):
		    return 0
		else:
		    return Length
	# Return the possible value of subtring
	return ans
if __name__ == '__main__':
	Binary_String = "10101"
	print(solve(Binary_String))

#### Output:

### Complexity Analysis

> Since there is only one for loop in the program, the time complexity of the whole algorithm will be,   ___O(Length)___.
> Also we are not alocating any run time memory, so the Auxiliary Space complexity will be ___O(1)___.
