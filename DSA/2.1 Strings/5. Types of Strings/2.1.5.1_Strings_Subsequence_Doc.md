# String Subsequence

## What is Subsequence?
* A string is called as a subsequence when its characters are in same order as in the other string but it may or may not be continuous.  

For example: 
* GSCPT is a subsequence of GIRLSCRIPT  
* GSLPT is not a subsequence of GIRLSCRIPT

### Example Code Snippet
```C++
//C++ Language Program to find if a string is a subsequence of another string

string s1 = "GSCPT";
string s2 = "GIRLSCRIPT";

int i, j = 0;

/* using for loop(variable i) to traverse through s2 
   and j for traversing s1 */
for (i=0; i<s2.length() && j<s1.length(); i++)
        /* j is incremented whenever match of characters 
           in found between s1 and s2, so that next character 
           of s1 can be now compared in next iteration*/
        if (s1[j] == s2[i])
            j++;

// j == m if all characters from s1 where available in s2
if(j==m)
    cout<<"s1 is subsequence of s2"<<endl;
else 
    cout<<"s1 is subsequence of s2"<<endl;
```  

### Output  
``` 
s1 is subsequence of s2 
```  
**Time Complexity - O(N)**  
**Space Complexty - O(1)**


## Find All Subsequences of a String
* A string of length n can have 2<sup>n</sup> number of string subsequences.  

### Example Code Snippet 
```C++
/* This is a function which has two strings as parameters
   Initially str is the given string and seq is empty string*/
void subsequences(string str, string seq){
    // if str is empty, then print seq
    if(str == ""){
        cout<<seq<<" ";
        return;
    }
    /* Recursive call with arguments as
       1. str substring from index 1 and
       2. first character of str appended to seq */
    subsequences(str.substr(1), seq + str[0]);
 
    /* Recursive call with arguments as
       1. str substring from index 1 and
       2. seq */
    subsequences(str.substr(1), seq);
}

int main(){
    string s1 = "ABC";
    subsequences(s1, "");
    return 0;
}
```  

### Output
```
ABC AB AC A BC B C
```
**Time Complexity - O(2<sup>N</sup>)**  
**Space Complexty - O(1)**
