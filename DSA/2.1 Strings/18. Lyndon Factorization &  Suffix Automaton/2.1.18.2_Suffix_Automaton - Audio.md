# Suffix Automaton

A suffix automaton is a powerful data structure that allows solving many string-related problems. The suffix automaton for the given strings is called a minimal deterministic finite automaton that accepts all suffixes of the string s.

For example, you can search for all occurrences of one string in another, or count the amount of
different substrings of a given string. Both tasks can be solved in linear time with the help of a suffix automaton.

A suffix automaton is an oriented acyclic graph. The vertices are called states, and the edges are called transitions between states. Suffix trees and suffix arrays are data structures containting all the suffixes of a string and There are multiple algorithms to build and act on these structures to perform operations efficiently on strings.
 
## Properties of Suffix Automaton
 
The simplest, and yet most important property of the suffix automaton is that it contains information about all the substrings of the string s. Namely, any path from the initial state t_0 if we write out the labels of the arcs along this path, forms necessarily a substring of a string s. Conversely, any substring of the string s corresponds to some path starting in the initial state t_0.
