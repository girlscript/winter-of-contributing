# **Lyndon Factorization & Duval Algorithm**
    
## **What is Lyndon Factorization:**
    In simple words, Lyndon Factorization is the technique of decomposition of string into its substring which are simple string.
    Now, What are simple string ?
    A simple string is any string which is strictly smaller than all its non-trivial or non-empty suffixes, and strictly smaller in lexicographical order than all its rotations or cyclic shifts.

    For any string S, the Lyndon Factorization of S will be S = w(1)w(2)w(3)...w(k), where for all w(i)[i: 1 to k] are simple, and in increasing order, such as:
    w(1) >= w(2) >= w(3) >= ... >= w(k)

## **Real World Application:**
- Used in identifing the finger print, We can encode the structure of finger print into multiple circular strings, and circular comparision is also required inorder to recognize the finger print.
- We can also implement this algorithm into some word related games or puzzles.
- In order to identify the genetic group of bacteria or virus, we can use Duval algorithm.

## **Explanation of Duval Algorithm:**
    Lyndon Factorization can be found with the help of Duval Algorithm, it construct all the Lyndon Factorization in just O(n) time and using O(1) addition memory space.
    Duval algorihtm is said to be a greedy algorithm as it works in order to collect all the Lyndon Factorization of any given string.
    Here a given string is divided into three sub parts: s(1), s(2), and s(3).
    where, 
    s(1): Whose Lyndon Factorization is already found by the algorithm, 
    s(2): It is a pre-simple string(a pre-simple string is a string in the form, S = www...w...), and 
    s(3): This is remaining part of the string which is yet to operate.

    There will be total of three pointer, 'i', 'j', and 'k', from which 'i' pointer will used to iterate over the complete string, starting from '0 to n'(length of the given string). Inside the outer loop, 'j' pointer will points to the beginning of the 's(3)'[the remaining of string] and 'k' pointer will points to the current character of the string on which the algorithm is currently operating.
    
    Now we wil add the character s[j] to the sting s(2), after performing a comparision and taking three cases into consideration:
    # if s[j] = s[k], then adding the character to s(2) will not disturb the pr#simplicity of the string s(2), simply increment the pointer j and k.
    # if s[j] > s[k], here if we concate s[j] with s(2), then the string s(2) b#came simple, we only need to increment the 'j' pointer and reset the 'k' at the beginning of the string s(2), inorder to check for the next iteration.
    # if s[j] < s[k], in this case after concatinating s[j] with s(2), the stri#g s(2) will not remain the simple anym more, therefore we need to split the string s(2) into its further simple string and the remaining part. The simple string in this case will be having a length of 'j-k', and we leave the remaining part to compute it in the next iteration.

## **Complexity analysis:**
### **Time Complexity:**
    As the outer loop only execute 'n' times, where 'n' is the length of the given string and the inner while loop is just extracting the Lyndon Factorization and storing it into an array to return it, therefore we only need to consider the very first loop. Therefore the overall Time Complexity of the algorithm will be: O(n) 

### **Space Complexity:**
    In order to implement the Duval Algorithm, as we have not used any extra memory rather than few variables, therefore the space complexity of the algorithms would be just: O(1)

## **Implementation in C++:**
```cpp
// Including header files.
#include<iostream>  // For cout and cin.
#include<vector>    // For displaying Queue.
using namespace std;

// getFactorization() function that will take string as a 
// function argument and return all the valid Lyndon Factorization
// of the given string.
vector<string> getFactorization(string &str) {
	// Initializing variables for computation.
    int n = str.size(), i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
    // To store all the valind Lyndon Factorization.
    vector<string> facts;
    // Iterating over the complete string.
    while (i < n) {
        j = i+1; k = i;
        while (str[k] <= str[j] and j < n) {
            if (str[k] < str[j])
                k = i;
            else
                k++;
            j++;
        }
        while (i <= k) {
        	string fact = str.substr(i, j-k);
        	// Storing after computing in an array.
            facts.push_back(fact);
            i += j-k;
        }
    }
    // Returning all the valid Lyndon Factorization of string.
    return facts;
}

// main function or the driver function.
int main(){
	// Variable for taking input of string from the user.
	string  str =  "";
	cout<< "Enter a string to find its Lyndon Factorization: ";
	cin>> str;
	// Calling getFactorization() function,
	// over the user entered string and storing the result in an array.
	vector<string> facts = getFactorization(str);
	// Printing the facts arrays on the console.
	cout<< "\nLyndon Factorization of the given strings are: "<< endl;
	for(auto x: facts)
		cout<< "-> "<< x<< endl;

	// End of main function().
	return 0;
}
```
