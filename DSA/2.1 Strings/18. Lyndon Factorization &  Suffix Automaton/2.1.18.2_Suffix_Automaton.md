# Suffix Automation
A **suffix automaton**, also known as ***Directed-Acyclic-Word-Graph*** (DAWG), for a string "S" is the minimal **d**eterministic **f**inite **a**utomaton (DFA) that accepts all suffixes of the given string S. It can be understood as a compressed form of all substrings of a given string *i.e.,* it contains all the information in a highly compressed form.

A suffix automation is a strong data structure that helps in solving many string-related problems like, one can search for all occurrences of one string in another, or count the amount of different substrings of a given string.
<br/>For a string of length *n* both time and space complexity is ***O(n)*** and if we consider the size *k* of the alphabet as a constant both the time and space complexity will be ***O(nlogk)***.

### Points to Consider:
- A suffix automation is an oriented acyclic graph. The vertices are called **states**, and the edges are called **transitions** between states.
- One of the states *"t0"* is the **initial state**, and it must be the source of the graph.
- Each transition is labeled with some character of a string. All transitions originating from a state must have different **labels**.
- One or multiple states are marked as **terminal states** such that if we go from  *"to"* to any of these terminal states and note down the labels of the edges then we get is a suffix of the original string “S”.
- The suffix automaton contains the minimum number of vertices or states among all automata.

### let's understand the suffix automata with the help of an example

For the string : **"abbb"**.
The suffixes will be **b**, **bb**, **bbb**, **abbb**. We'll find all these suffixes in the  following figure.

Initial state ***"t0"*** is denoted by blue and terminal states ***1, 2, 3*** are marked with green.
#### If we start from initial state ***"t0"*** to the terminal state:
- **1** the suffix will be **"b"**.
- **2** the suffix will be **"bb"**.
- **3** via ***1*** and ***2***  the suffix will be **"bbb"**.
- **3** the suffix will be **"abbb"**.

## Substring property
The simplest and most important property of a suffix automaton is, that it contains information about all substrings of the string S. Any path starting at the initial state "t0", if we write down the labels of the transitions, forms a substring of S. And conversely every substring of S corresponds to a certain path starting at "t0".
One or multiple paths can lead to a state. Thus, we will say that a state corresponds to the set of strings, which correspond to these paths.

If we consider above diagram starting from **initial state** travelling to each **state** we'll get all the substrings of **"abbb"** i.e., *a, ab, abb, abbb, b, bb, bbb.*
## Implementation

```cpp

//struct will store all information about a specific transition 
//like len, link and the list of transitions 
//i.e., in the form of a map
struct state {
    int len, link;
    map<char,int>next;
};

 //the variable sz store the current size 
 //and also the variable last is the state 
 //corresponding to the entire string at the moment. 
const int MAXLEN = 100000;
state st[MAXLEN*2];
int sz, last;
 
//sa_init() function initializes a 
//suffix automaton with a single state 
void sa_init() {
    sz = last = 0;
    st[0].len = 0;
    st[0].link = -1;
    ++sz;}
  
  //implementation of the main function adds 
  //the next character to the end 
  //of the current line and 
  //rebuilding the machine accordingly.
void sa_extend (char c) {
    int cur = sz++;
    st[cur].len = st[last].len + 1;
    int p;
    for (p=last; p!=-1 && !st[p].next.count(c); p=st[p].link)
        st[p].next[c] = cur;
    if (p == -1)
        st[cur].link = 0;
    else {
        int q = st[p].next[c];
        if (st[p].len + 1 == st[q].len)
            st[cur].link = q;
        else {
            int clone = sz++;
            st[clone].len = st[p].len + 1;
            st[clone].next = st[q].next;
            st[clone].link = st[q].link;
            for (; p!=-1 && st[p].next[c]==q; p=st[p].link)
                st[p].next[c] = clone;
            st[q].link = st[cur].link = clone;
        }
    }
    last = cur;
}
```
