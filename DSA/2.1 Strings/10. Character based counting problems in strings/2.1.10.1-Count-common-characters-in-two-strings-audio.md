# Brief summary on the audio clip :

It contains how to appraoch the problem given and space and time complexities of the problem.

# Concludingly :

    The question asked to count the characters that are common in both the input strings.
    We approached the problem by storing the frequency of each character in a string in a separate array and the minimum frequency of a character from both the strings would add to our answer.
    ** TIME COMPLEXITY : O(N1+N2) where N1 is the length of first string and N2 is the length of the second string.**
    ** SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1)  Since we are using constant 26 size array to store the frequencies. **
