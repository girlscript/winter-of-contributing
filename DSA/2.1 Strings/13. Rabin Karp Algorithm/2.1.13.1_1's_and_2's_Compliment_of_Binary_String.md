# **1's and 2's Compliment of Binary String**

## **What is 1's and 2's Compliment of Binary String ?**  
   **Binary Number** is expressed in base 2. It uses only two digits ‘0’ and ‘1’. Each digit in a binary number is a bit.

   Sample Binary Number − 0100010111

### 1’s Complement
One's complement of a binary number is obtained by reversing the digits of the binary number i.e. transforming 1 with 0 and 0 with 1.

#### Example

>1’s Complement of 101100 = 010011

### 2’s Complement
Two’s complement of a binary number is obtained by adding one to the one’s complement of a binary number i.e. 1’s complement + 1.

#### Example

>2’s complement of 101101 = 010011
     
- ## **1’s Complement :** 
    One's complement of a binary number is obtained by reversing the digits of the binary number i.e. transforming 1 with 0 and 0 with 1.
    
    #### Example 

    1’s Complement of 101100 = 010011
    
    ### **Algorithm :**
    ```
    Flip all the digits of the binary number (Convert '0' to '1' & '1' to '0')
    ```

    ### **Implementation of the above approach :**  
    ```cpp
        /* C++ program for finding 1's complement */
        #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
        void onceComplement(string &binary) {
            for(auto &i:binary) {
                //Inverting the bits 
                if(i=='0') i='1';
                else i='0';
            }
        }
        int main() {
            string binary;
            cin>>binary;
            onceComplement(binary);
            cout<<"One's Complement is "<<binary<<endl;
            return 0;
        }
    ```
    ## **Time Complexity :**  
    1's Complement of a binary number takes **θ(n)** where n = length of the binary number.
    >Hence the time complexity is **θ(N)** , i.e, **Linear Time Complexity.**


    ## **Space Complexity :**  
    1's Complement of the binary number is found in place without any extra space being used.

    >Hence, the space complexity is **θ(1).**

- ## **2’s Complement :** 
    Two’s complement of a binary number is obtained by adding one to the one’s complement of a binary number i.e. 1’s complement + 1.

    #### Example

    2’s complement of 101101 = 010011
    
    ### **Algorithm :**
    ```
    Flip all the digits of the binary number (Convert '0' to '1' & '1' to '0') & add 1 to it
    ```

    ### **Implementation of the above approach :**  
    ```cpp
        /* C++ program for finding 1's complement */
        #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
        void twosComplement(string &binary) {
            //Calculating 1's Complement
            for(auto &i:binary) {
                //Inverting the bits
                if(i=='0') i='1';
                else i='0';
            }
            //Adding 1 to calculated 1's Complement 
            for(int i=binary.size()-1;i>=0;i--) {
                //If the digit is '0' then invert it & stop traversing
                if(binary[i]=='0') {
                    binary[i]='1';
                    break;
                }
                else binary[i]='0';
            }
        }
        int main() {
            string binary;
            cin>>binary;
            twosComplement(binary);
            cout<<"Two's Complement is "<<binary<<endl;
            return 0;
        }
    ```
    ## **Time Complexity :**  
    2's Complement of a binary number takes **O(n)** where n = length of the binary number.Firstly, We will do 1's complement that will take **θ(n)** & adding 1 to that number will take **O(n)**.So the overall time complexity will be **O(n)**.
    >Hence the time complexity is **O(N)** , i.e. **Linear Time Complexity.**


    ## **Space Complexity :**  
    The 2's complements of the binary number is found in place without any extra space being used.

    >Hence, the space complexity is **θ(1).**
