# Rabin-Karp Algorithm

Rabin-Karp Algorithm is a famous string-searching algorithm.

It uses a **rolling hash** function which is implemented using **Rabin Fingerprint**. Usage of rolling hash function saves the hard work of repetitive comparisons of overlapping pattern. The hash function is as follows:

Now, once a set of characters are calculated using this formula and if pattern is not found then we can easily compute next set of characters using following logic:

We should always use these strong hash functions because using naive mapping results in **spurious hits** (hash values are same even when the pattern isn't matching).

The performance of Rabin-Karp algorithm highly depends on an efficient hash function. 

## Time Complexity:

Worst case : `O(|text|*|pattern|)`

Average and Best case: `O(|text| - |pattern| + 1)`
