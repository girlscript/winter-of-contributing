The Rabin Karp algorithm is an algorithm used for matching string patterns. Unlike the normal string- matching algorithms that check each character of the string one by one for each character, the Rabin Karp algorithm uses a sliding window to check for a match, however, it calculates a hash value for each window and for the pattern that we have to find. It then checks for the equality of hash values, in case they match, the pattern is found. In case the hash values donâ€™t match, we move on to the next window and calculate the hash values again.


Our hash function also needs to be efficient in calculating the hash values and to shift the values from one window to the next effectively. The hash value recommended by Rabin Karp calculates an integer value every time.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity for the Rabin Karp algorithm is O(n-m+1) in the worst case, where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.
