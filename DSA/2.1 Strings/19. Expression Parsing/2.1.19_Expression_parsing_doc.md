## Expression parsing ##
Expression parsing is used to evaluate logical and arithmetic expressions in data structures. A notation can be used to represent arithmetic operations. 
It's important to remember that a notation is simply a method of representation. Regardless of the notation chosen, the expression's result stays the same.
There are three distinct notations for arithmetic expressions, i.e. three methods to write an arithmetic expression:

- Infix notation

- Postfix notation

- Prefix notation
## Infix notation
Infix notation is used to write expressions, such as c - d * e, where operators are used in-between operands.
## Prefix notation
In this notation the operator is prefixed to the operands, which means it is written before the operands. For instance, -ab.

## Postfix notation
In this notation the operator is postfixed to the operands, which means it is written after the operands. For instance, ab-.


Let us first grasp the concepts of precedence and associativity
## Precedence
Precedence determines the order which the operators must follow throughout the evaluation of an expression.
If precedence fails to determine the order, we turn to associativity for assistance. 


Order of precedence of most likely used operators are:
```
1	Exponentiation(^)                      --> Highest	
2	Multiplication ( âˆ— ) & Division ( / )  --> Second Highest	
3	Addition ( + ) & Subtraction ( âˆ’ )     --> Lowest
 ```
## associativity
When an expression contain two or more operators of same precedence then we take help of associativity to decide the order in which evalution will be done.
Associativity can be in two order:
- left to right
- right to left


## Why do we need to parse an expression?

It is inefficient to develop an algorithm or programme to parse infix notations .
Instead, infix notations are transformed into postfix or prefix notations before being calculated. Therefore, we need to convert the infix expressions into a prefix or postfix expression. Let us see both the conversions.
## Infix to postfix conversion:
```
Step 1: Initialize the stack.
Step 2: In the infix expression, scan the operator from left to right.
Step 3: If the leftmost character is an operand, set it as the Postfix string's current output.
Step 4: Push the operator into the Stack if the scanned character is the operator and the Stack is empty or includes the '(', ')' symbol.
Step 5: Place the scanned operator on the Stack if it has a higher precedence than the current precedence operator in the Stack or if the Stack is empty.
Step 6: Pop all Stack operators if the scanned operator has lower precedence than the current operator in the Stack. Push the scanned operator into the Stack after that.
Step 7: Push the scanned character into the Stack if it is a left bracket '('.
Step 8: If the right bracket ')' is met, pop the Stack and print all output string characters until the character '(' is reached, then delete both brackets.
Step 9: Repeat steps 2â€“8 until you've scanned the infix expression.
Step 10: Print the output of the Stack.
Step 11: Pop and output all characters from the Stack, including the operator, until it isn't empty.
```

## Infix to prefix conversion
```
Step 1: To begin, invert the infix phrase provided in the problem.
Step 2: Scanning the phrase from left to right is the next step.
Step 3: Print the operands as soon as they arrive.
Step 4: If the operator comes and discovers that the stack is empty, just put the operator into the stack.
Step 5: Push the arriving operator onto the stack if it has a higher precedence than the TOP of the stack.
Step 6: Push the arriving operator into the stack if the arriving operator has the same priority as a TOP of the stack.
Step 7: Pop and print the top of the stack if the arriving operator has a lower precedence than the TOP of the stack. Test the arriving operator against the top of the stack once again, then pop it off the stack until it finds an operator with a lower or equal precedence.
Step 8: If the arriving operator and the top of the stack have the same precedence and the arriving operator is^, pop the top of the stack until the condition is true. Push the ^Â Â operator if the condition isn't true.
Step 9: Pop and print all the operators from the top of the stack once we come to the end of the expression.
Step 10: Push the operator onto the stack if it is ')'.
Step 11: If the operator is '(,' pop all the operators from the stack until it finds) an opening bracket.
Step 12: Push the operator on the stack if the top of the stack is ')'.
Step 13: Reverse the output at the end.
```
## Algorithm for expression parsing:
```
Step 1: Scan each of the expression's symbols one by one.
Step 2: We push the input character into the stack if it is an operand.
Step 3: If the input character is an operator, it is popped out and the appropriate action is performed.
Step 4: Push the operation's result back into the stack.
Step 5: Repeat steps 1â€“4 until all of the operations have been completed.
Step 6: PopÂ the stack. Carry out the last operation.
```
