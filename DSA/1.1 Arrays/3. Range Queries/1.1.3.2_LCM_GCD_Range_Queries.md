## Problem Statement 
You have an integer array and q number of queries. Each query contains the (left, right) as a range. The given task is to find out the LCM(left, right), i.e, 
LCM of all the number that comes in the range of left and right inclusively.

## Example
### Input
```
arr[] = {3,4,5,7,9,11,13};
Query: {(1, 4), (3, 6), (2,5)}
```
### Output
```
1260 9009 3465
```

## Explanation 
```
The given array is 
| 3 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 13 |   
Let's have a look at first query which is (1,4). This means we have to find LCM of elements starting from index 1 to index 4 both inclusive.
| 3 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 13 | 
      |___________|      - LCM of 4,5,7,9 is 1260.
      
The next query is (3,6).This means we have to find LCM of elements starting from index 3 to index 6 both inclusive.
| 3 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 13 | 
               |____________| -LCM of 7,9,11,13 is 9009.
```

## Algorithm
1. Declare two arrays (one for the numbers and one for queries).
2. Make a **segment tree** .
3. To find the LCM of a number, divide the product of the left child and right child by their GCD.
4. Get the LCM for the left child node and the right child node.
5. For each query, if the range is not valid then return 1, else check if the left is less than the starting value of the node 
and the right is greater than the value of the ending node, then return the current value node of the tree.
6. If any of the above conditions are not true, else recursively call the function to get the left node lcm and the right node lcm and then call the 
lcm function to get the LCM of these numbers.

## Code
```C++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
#define SIZE 1000
int tree[4*SIZE];
int arr[SIZE];
int GCD(int a, int b)  //GCD of 2 numbers 
{
    if (a == 0)
        return b;
    return GCD(b%a, a);
}
int LCM(int a, int b) //LCM of 2 numbers is the product of 2 numbers divided by the gcd of same to numbers.
{
    return a*b/GCD(a,b);
}
int solve(int node, int start, int end, int left, int right) //solve queries
{
    if (end < left || start > right) //invalid indices
        return 1;
    if (left<=start && right >=end)
        return tree[node];
    int mid = (start+end)/2; //find mid to divide the array
    int leftChildLCM = solve(2*node, start, mid, left, right); //left child lcm 
    int rightChildLCM = solve(2*node+1, mid+1, end, left, right); //right child lcm 
    return LCM(leftChildLCM, rightChildLCM); //lcm of left and right child 
}
void makeTree(int node, int start, int end)  //make segment tree
{
    if (start==end)
    {
        tree[node] = arr[start];
        return;
    }
    int mid = (start+end)/2;
    makeTree(2*node, start, mid); //left child
    makeTree(2*node+1, mid+1, end); //right child
    int leftChildLCM = tree[2*node];
    int rightChildLCM = tree[2*node+1];
    tree[node] = LCM(leftChildLCM, rightChildLCM);
}
int main()
{
    arr[0]=3;
    arr[1]=4;
    arr[2]=5;
    arr[3]=7;
    arr[4]=9;
    arr[5]=11;
    arr[6]=13;
    makeTree(1,0,6);
    cout << solve(1, 0, 6, 1, 4) << endl;
    cout << solve(1, 0, 6, 3, 6) << endl;
    cout << solve(1, 0, 6, 2, 5) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Output 
```
1260
9009
3465
```
