## Problem Statement 
Given an array of size N and Q queries in the form of L R X. For each query give the output Yes or No if X present in between the indices L and R(included).

## Example
```
Input : N = 4
        arr = [1, 2, 3, 5]          //1 based index
        Q = 2
        1 2 4
        1 3 2
```
## Output 
```
No
Yes
```
## Explanation 
```
for the first query you can see that 4 does not exist between the indices 1 and 2 of array So output will be No.
            ___ ___ ___ ___
           | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
             ^   ^   ^   ^
             |   |   |   |
             1   2   3   4  <---index of array

For the second query you can see that 2 exist between the indices 1 and 3 so output will be Yes.
            ___ ___ ___ ___
           | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
             ^   ^   ^   ^
             |   |   |   |
             1   2   3   4  <---index of array


```
## Algorithm
1. Combine all the elements that are consecutively equal into a single group.

2. Let R be the index.
3. Start with R while processing a query. 
4. Let i be the index of array.

5. Compare and contrast a[i] and X. If they're equal, print "Yes" and stop traversing the remainder of the range. Otherwise, skip all the following members in the a[i] group. 
6. The index of this group's root becomes one less than the index of this group's root.

7. Continue until X is found or index is less than L, whichever occurs first.

8. If index falls below L, print "No."
## Code
```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<array>
using namespace std;
struct Query           //query range's structure
{
    int L, R, X;
};
int root[100];
int find(int y)          //Find the group's root, which includes the element at index x.
{
    if(y==root[y]){
      return y;
    }else{
      root[y]=find(root[y]);
      return root[y];
    }
}

int merge(int a, int b)        //merge the two groups which have elements at indices a and b
{
    int x = find(a),y = find(b);
    if (x != y) {
        root[x] = root[y];
    }
}
 
void start(int arr[], int N, Query q[], int n)
{
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        root[i] = i;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++)
        if (arr[i] == a[i - 1])
            merge(i, i - 1);
}
 

int main()
{
    int a[] = { 1, 2, 3, 5};
    int n = arr.size();
    Query q[] = { { 1, 2, 4 }, { 1, 3, 2 } };
    int q_size = sizeof(q) / sizeof(q[0]);
    start(arr, n, q, q_size);
 
    for (int i = 0; i < q_size; i++)
    {
        int flag = 0;
        int l = q[i].L, r = q[i].R, x = q[i].X;
        int S = r;
 
        while (S >= l)
        {
            if (arr[S] == x)
            {
                flag = 1;
                break;
            }
            S = find(S) - 1;
        }
 
        // Print if x exists or not
        if (flag != 0)
            cout <<"Yes"<< endl;
        else
            cout <<"No"<< endl;
    }
}
```

## Output
```
No 
Yes
```
## Time complexity
Time complexty for each query will be O(n) and there are Q queries so time complexity will be O(Q*n).
