# **Square Root Decomposition**

## **What is Square Root Decomposition technique?**
    Sqrt Decomposition is a method (or a data structure) that allows you to perform some common operations (finding sum of the elements of the sub-array, finding the minimal/maximal element, etc.) in O(âˆšn) operations, which is much faster than O(n) for the trivial algorithm.

## **Explanation of algorithm:**
    The basic idea of sqrt decomposition is preprocessing. We'll divide the array a into blocks of length approximately âˆšn, and for each block i we'll precalculate the sum of elements in it b[i].
    
    We can assume that both the size of the block and the number of blocks are equal to âˆšn rounded up:
                                                s = âŒˆâˆšnâŒ‰

    The last block may have fewer elements than the others (if n not a multiple of s), it is not important to the discussion (as it can be handled easily).

    So, we have calculated the values of b[k] (this required O(n) operations). How can they help us to answer each query [l, r]? Notice that if the interval [l, r] is long enough, it will contain several whole blocks, and for those blocks we can find the sum of elements in them in a single operation. As a result, the interval [l, r] will contain parts of only two blocks, and we'll have to calculate the sum of elements in these parts trivially.

    Thus, in order to calculate the sum of elements on the interval [l, r] we only need to sum the elements of the two "tails": [lâ€¦(k+1) â‹… sâˆ’1] and [p â‹… sâ€¦r].

    Note: When k = p, i.e. l and r belong to the same block, the formula can't be applied, and the sum should be calculated trivially.

    This approach allows us to significantly reduce the number of operations. Indeed, the size of each "tail" does not exceed the block length s, and the number of blocks in the sum does not exceed s. Since we have chosen sâ‰ˆâˆšn, the total number of operations required to find the sum of elements on the interval [l, r] is O(âˆšn).

## **Complexity analysis:**
### **Time Complexity:**
    Letâ€™s consider a query [l = 1 and r = n-2] (where n is the size of the array and has a 0 based indexing). Therefore, for this query exactly (âˆšn â€“ 2) blocks will be completely overlapped where as the first and last block will be partially overlapped with just one element left outside the overlapping range. So, the completely overlapped blocks can be summed up in (âˆšn â€“ 2) ~ âˆšn iterations, whereas first and last block are needed to be traversed one by one separately. But as we know that the number of elements in each block is at max sqrt(n), to sum up last block individually we need to make, (âˆšn-1) ~ âˆšn iterations and same for the last block. So, the overall Time Complexity:
        O(âˆšn) + O(âˆšn) + O(sqrt(n)) = O(3*âˆšn) = O(âˆšn)
### **Space Complexity:**
    As the extra space has been used for the âˆšn size(where n is the number of element in an arary) for calculating and storing the block sum, therefore the space complexity of the algorithm will be:
        O(âˆšn)

## **Input/Output:**
### **Sample Input:**
    Input Arr: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 3, 1, 9, 7
### **Sample Output:**
    Array Is:
    1 2 6 7 9 3 1 9 7
    Block Sum Is:
    9 19 17

    Square Root Decomposition:
    Array Is:
    1 2 6 7 9 3 8 9 7
    Block Sum Is:
    9 19 24

    Sum Query Within Range 2 to 7 Is: 42
