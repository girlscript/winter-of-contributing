## Problem Statement 
You have an integer array and q number of queries. The task is to find Sum and Product of numbers from i to j.


## Example
### Input
```
 arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
        i = 1, j = 3
        i = 2, j = 4
        
arr[] = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}   
 queries[] = {(3, 5), (2, 2), (2, 3)}
  
```
### Output
```
 9
 12

 7500, 10, 150
```

## Explanation 
```
Solution to Pre-Compute the sum for every query 
Solution is implemented by prefix Sum
prefix[i] will be storing sum of elements from the given array a[0] to a[i];
to provide answer to our query(i,j) we'll return prefix[j]-prefix[i-1]
for PrefixSum it's assumed that i<=j 
Similarly like precomputing sum of elements we can just precompute product But do you think this will work? (edge-cases)
So if any single element in our array turns out to be 0 so our product array will be containing 0 after that elements

How to counter?

to counter this case we will use another array to count number of zeros which will contain number of 0's the array has 
upto index i


if countzero[high]-countzero[lo]>0 then this is the condition where 0 is present in that range 
so our answer will be 0 

 Rangesum function Returns sum of elements in array[i..j]

Time complexity wil be O(n) after traversing array thne O(1) per query recived 
```

## Algorithm for Prefix Sum
1. Declare an Prefix sum array 
2. Store sum of elements from i = 0 to i=n
3. Return prefix[j]-prefix[i-1] 

## Algorithm for Product
1. Declare a PreProduct array
2. To store Products of elements from i=0 to i=n
3. Just Remember for case when you encounter 0
4. Declare another array to solve this case to store count of zeros
 

## Code
```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

 
 void preSum(int array[], int n, int prefixSum[])
    {
        prefixSum[0] = array[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        {
            prefixSum[i] = array[i] + prefixSum[i - 1];
        }
    }
 



 
int rangeSum(int i, int j, int preSum[])
{
    if (i == 0)
        return preSum[j];
 
    return preSum[j] - preSum[i - 1];
}




void findProduct(int arr[], int lo[],int hi[], int n, int n1)
{
    long preProduct[n];
    int countZero[n];
 
    long prod = 1;  
 
 
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
 
 
        if (arr[i] == 0)
            count++;
        else
            prod *= arr[i];
 
         
        preProduct[i] = prod;
 
 
        countZero[i] = count;
    }
 
 
    for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
    {
        int l = lo[i];
        int u = hi[i];
 
        if (l == 1)
        {
 
            if (countZero[u - 1] == 0)
                cout << (preProduct[u - 1]) << endl;
            else
                cout<<0<<endl;
        }
 
        else  
        {
             
            if (countZero[u - 1] -
                countZero[l - 2] == 0)
                cout << (preProduct[u - 1] /
                         preProduct[l - 2]) << endl;
 
            else  
                cout << 0 << endl;
        }
    }
}
 


int main()
{
        int array[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        int n = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);
     
        int prefixSum[n];
        preSum(array, n, prefixSum);
        cout << rangeSum(1, 3, prefixSum) << endl;       
        cout << rangeSum(2, 4, prefixSum) << endl;       


        int lo[] = {1, 2};               
        int hi[] = {3, 2};               
        findProduct(array, lo, hi,5,2);     
         

     
 
    return 0;
}
```
