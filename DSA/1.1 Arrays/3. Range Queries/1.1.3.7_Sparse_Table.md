# **Sparse Table Concept & Implementation**

## **What is Sparse Table**
    Sparse Table is a special form of data structure which is useful for answering the range queries problem, and specially the Minimum Range Queries, in which we have to find the Minimum number in a given range for the given array. By using Sparse Table, we can answer any range query in just O(1) time.

## **Drawback:**
    The one and only drawback of Sparse Table is that, the array on which we will be executing the range queries should have to be immutable in nature, It simply means that the array should not change in between the execution of queries.
    
    In case any value of array changes in between, than the complete array has to be re-computed for the further execution of queries.

## **Explanation of algorithm:**.
    As a pre-computation, we use a two-dimentional array fro storing precomputed values of queries. sparse[i][j] will store the value for the range [i, i+(2^j)-1] of length 2^j. The size of the two-dimensional array will be N×(K+1), where N is the length of the given array. And K has to satisfy K ≥ ⌊(log2)N⌋, because (2^⌊(log2)N⌋) is the largest power of two range, that the array will support.
```cpp
    vector<vector<int>> sparse(lg[n] + 1, vector<int>(n));
```
    
    Now we requires to compute the value of log2(R−L+1) so that we can answer every range query in just O(1). We can compute the logarithm for all as a pre-computation:
```cpp
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        sparse[0][j] = arr[j];
```

    As we can observe that the range [i, i+(2^j)−1] of length 2^j splits perfectly into the ranges [i, i+(2^j−1)−1] and [i+(2^j−1), i+(2^j)−1], both of length (2^j−1). And in case of Range Minimum Query we can divide the whole array into two part in the length as power of two and can compute the minimum for each range in just O(1).
    Now we can obtain the table efficiently using dynamic programming:
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= lg[n]; i++)
    for (int j = 0; (j+(1<<i)-1) < n; j++) // (1 << x) => 2^x
        sparse[i][j] = min(sparse[i-1][j], sparse[i-1][j+(1<<(i-1))]);
```
    

## **Complexity analysis:**
### **Time Complexity:**
    For pre-computation of log for every element of an array will be: O(n)
    For computing the complete sparse Table will be: O(n*n)
    For answering every range query will be: O(1)

    Therefore Sparse Table supports Queries in: O(1), but requires the pre-computation of O(n*n).
### **Space Complexity:**
    As we need to pre-compute the value of log for every element in an array and also create the complete sparse table, therefore it uses the extra space of: O(n*n)

## **Input/Output:**
### **Sample Input:**
    Enter no. of elements in an array: 6
    Enter no. of Queries to make: 2
    Enter 6 elements of array: 2 3 0 -3 5 1
### **Sample Output:**
    [Query 1] Enter L and R: 1 4
    Minimum in range 1 - 4 is: -3

    [Query 2] Enter L and R: 3 6
    Minimum in range 3 - 6 is: -3

## **Program Code in C++:**
```cpp
// Including header files.
#include<iostream> // For using cout and cin.
#include<vector>   // for using vector<int>
using namespace std;

// main() function or the driver function.
int main(){
    // Declaring variables for storing values.
    int n, queries;
    // Taking input for the number of elements in an array.
    cout<< "\nEnter no. of elements in an array: ";
    cin>> n;

    cout<< "Enter no. of Queries to make: ";
    // Taking input for the number of Queries to make,
    // in an array.
    cin>> queries;
    
    vector<int> arr(n);
    // Taking input for the elements of array.
    cout<< "Enter "<< n<< " elements of array: ";
    for(auto &x: arr)
        cin>> x;
    
     // lg[i] = log2(i)
    vector<int> lg(n+1);
    // Pre-computing the logrithm array for every number form 1 to n,
    // basically stores the floor of log of that number.
    // So that we don't need to calculate log every time.
    lg[1] = 0;
    for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
        lg[i] = lg[i/2]+1;
 
    // Declaring sparse table.
    // sparse[i][j] : Minimum value in the interval [j, j+2^i-1]
    vector<vector<int>> sparse(lg[n] + 1, vector<int>(n));
    
    // Setting the elements of the first row of sparse table,
    // as the elements of the initial array.
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        sparse[0][j] = arr[j];
    
    // Calcularting the value of sparse table.
    for (int i = 1; i <= lg[n]; i++)
        for (int j = 0; (j+(1<<i)-1) < n; j++) // (1 << x) => 2^x
            sparse[i][j] = min(sparse[i-1][j], sparse[i-1][j+(1<<(i-1))]);
    
    // Initializing counter for counting,
    // number of queries.
    int count = 0;
    // Executing and priting the minimum in given range,
    // for every query in just O(1).
    while (queries--) {
        int l, r;
        cout<< "\n[Query "<<++count <<"] Enter L and R: ";
        cin>> l>> r;
        l--, r--;
 
        int i = lg[r-l+1];
        cout<< "Minimum in range "<< l+1<< " - "<< r+1<< " is: "<< min(sparse[i][l], sparse[i][r-(1<<i)+1])<< endl;
    }

    // End of main() function.
    return 0;
}
```
