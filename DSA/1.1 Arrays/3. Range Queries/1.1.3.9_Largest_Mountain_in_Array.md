## Longest Mountain in Array Problem
### Overview
Given an integer array arr, return the length of the longest subarray, which is a mountain. Return 0 if there is no mountain subarray.<br>
You may recall that an array arr is a **mountain array** if and only if:
- arr.length >= 3
- There exists some index i **(0-indexed)** with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
    - arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
    - arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
<hr>

### Solution
We would solve this problem with the following steps 

- We will try to find its peak i.e the point where the array will be of form {a[i] > a[i-1]} and {a[i] < a[i+1]} .
- Then after finding the point we will traverse the array in forward direction until a[i] is smaller then a[i+1] .
- Also we will traverse in the backward direction until the a[j] greater than a[j-1] .
- We will store the Max Length traversed in temp variable by doing temp = i - j .
- We will compare the temp value with Max value and store the Maximum length in Max Variable.

### Code Brute Force O(n^2) Approach
```
#include<iostream>
#include<climits>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    int a[16] = {5,6,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,0,1,2,3,-2,4};
    int len = INT_MIN;

    //The first and last number cannot be peak so skipping those
    for(int i = 1; i < (sizeof(a)/sizeof(int))-1; ++i){
        int height = 1;
        if((a[i]>a[i-1])&&(a[i]>a[i+1])){
            for(int j= i-1; a[j]<a[j+1];--j){
                height++;
            }
            for(int j= i+1; a[j]>a[j+1];++j){
                height++;
            }
            height++;
        }
        if(height>len)
            len = height;
    }
    cout<<len<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Code O(n) Approach.
```
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<climits>

using namespace std;

int highest_mountain(vector<int> a){
    int n = a.size();

    int largest = 0;

    for(int i = 1; i <= n-2;){

        //check a[i] is peak or not
        if(a[i]>a[i-1] and a[i]>a[i+1]){
            //do some work
            int count = 1;
            int j = i;

            //count backwards
            while(j>=1 and a[j]>a[j-1]){
                j--;
                count++;
            }


            //count forward
            while(i<=n-2 and a[i]>a[i+1]){
                i++;
                count++;
            }
            largest = max(largest,count);

        }
        else{
            i++;
        }
    }
    return largest;
}

int main(){

    vector<int> arr{5,6,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,0,1,2,3,-2,4};

    cout<<highest_mountain(arr);

    return 0;
}
```

### Input and Output Analysis
```
Given array is 
5,6,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,0,1,2,3,-2,4

Output : 9

Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,0] which has length 9 Having peak 5 with ends at 1 and 0. 
```

### Complexity analysis

**Auxiliary Space** : O(1) <br/>
**Time Complexity** : O(n)

## Example 1.
```
Input: arr = [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.
```
## Example 2.
```
Input: arr = [2,2,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no mountain.
```
## Contraints Followed/Passed

- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
- 0 <= arr[i] <= 10^4
- solved it using only one pass
- solved it in O(1) space
