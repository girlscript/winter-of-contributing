# Problem Statement
```
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
```
### Constraints
```
board.length == 9
board[i].length == 9
board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.
```
## Example 1
### Input
```
board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```
### Output
```
true
```
### Explanation
```
No digit is repeated in rows as well as in columns.All the sub boxes contain digits from 1-9 without repetition.Hence,this is a valid sudoku.

```
## Example 2
### Input
```
board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```
### Output
```
false
```
### Explanation
```
Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

## Algorithm
1. For the given 2D array,check if rows,column and sub boxes are valid individually,by calling function isRow,isCol,isSub respectively.
2. In isRow function by using map,check if any element from 0-9 is repeating itself in a row.If yes then return false,otherwise return true.
3. Repeat the step 2 for isCol to check column validity.
4. For isSub function for a particular element traverse in the 3x3 sub box and check if any element from 0-9 is repeating,if yes return false otherwise return true.
5. If answer from all three function is true,then sudoku is valid return true,otherwise return false. 
## Code

```C++
#include<map>
class Solution {
public:
    bool isRow(vector<vector<char>>&board,int row)      //Check the validity of row
    {
        unordered_map<int,bool>m;
        for(int j=0;j<9;j++)
        {
            if(m.count(board[row][j])>0)
                return false;
            if(board[row][j]!='.')
               m[board[row][j]]=true;
            
        }
        return true;
        
    }
    bool isCol(vector<vector<char>>&board,int col)      //Check the validity of column
    {
        unordered_map<int,bool>m;
        for(int i=0;i<9;i++)
        {
            if(m.count(board[i][col])>0)
                return false;
            if(board[i][col]!='.')
              m[board[i][col]]=true;
        }
        return true;
    }
    bool isSub(vector<vector<char>>&board,int row,int col)      //Check the validity of sub boxes
    {
        unordered_map<int,bool>m;
        for(int i=0;i<3;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<3;j++)
            {
                if(m.count(board[i+row][j+col])>0)
                    return false;
                if(board[i+row][j+col]!='.')
                    m[board[i+row][j+col]]=true;
            }
            
        }
        return true;
        
        
    }
    bool isValidSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board)     //Check if sudoku is valid or not
    {
        bool ans1=true;
        bool ans2=true;
        bool ans3=true;
        for(int i=0;i<9;i++)
        {
            ans1 = ans1 && isRow(board,i);
        }
        for(int j=0;j<9;j++)
        {
            ans2 = ans2 && isCol(board,j);
        }
        for(int i=0;i<9;i+=3)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<9;j+=3)
                ans3=ans3 && isSub(board,i,j);
        }
        return ans1&&ans2&&ans3;
    }
};
        
    

```
## Time Complexity
Time complexity for insertion in map is O(1) but we are also using count function of map which has time complexity of O(logN).In main function we are iterating in 2D array that implies over all time complexity is O(n^2).

## Space Complexity
We are using unordered maps for checking validity.Unordered maps are implemented using hash table i.e. Space Complexity is O(1).
