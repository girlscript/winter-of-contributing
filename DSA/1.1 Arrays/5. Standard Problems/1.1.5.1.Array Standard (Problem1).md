### Find the Relative complement of 2 sorted arrays.
## Problem Statement
Given two sorted arrays p and q of size m and n respectively. Find relative complement
 of two array.
 Complement of p means , element not in P. Similarly, relative complement means (p with respect to q) element present in q does not present in p i.e, array p - array q.

 ## Example
 ## Input
```
p[] = {2,3,5,6,8}
q[] = {1,2,3,4,6,9}
```
## Output
```
5 8
```
## Explanation
```
The given array is p:
| 2 | 3 | 5 | 6 | 8 | 
The given array is q:
| 1 |2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 9 | 
The 5 and 8 are present in array p but not in array q.
```
## Algorithm
1. Take two input of sorted array.
2. Iterate over the two sorted array using the two pointer i and j by using for loop
3. Now, check the condition
 i. If p[i] < q[j] ,then print p[i] and increament i.
ii. If p[i] > q[j] ,then increament j.
4. Else increament both the pointer.

## Below Code is the general case for any two sorted Array.


## Code
```C++
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
  
// Driver code 
int main() { 
    int m,n;  //declaration of length of array
    cin>>m;    // taking input of length of array
    int p[m];
  for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
      cin>>p[i];    // Taking input of sorted array p
  }
    cin>>n;
    int q[n];
  for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
      cin>>q[i];      // Taking input of sorted array q
  }
   
   int i = 0;  //initialising variable i and j
  int j = 0; 
  while(i < m && j < n){ 
  
    // If current element in p[] is 
    // smaller, than q[] then q[] can't present.
    if(p[i] < q[j]){ 
      cout << p[i] <<endl; 
      i+=1; }
  
    // Skipping smaller elements of 
    // q[] 
     else if (p[i] > q[j]) { 
      j+=1; }
  
    // If Equal elements found (increament in both arrays)  
   
     else if (p[i] == q[j]) { 
      i+=1; 
      j+=1; 
    } 
  } 
  
  // Print the rest array
  while (i < m)  
    cout << p[i]<<" ";  
    
    //Output is the relative complement of two array.
  
} 
```

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity 
```
  Time Complexity = O(m+n)
  Space Complexity = O(m+n)
  ```
