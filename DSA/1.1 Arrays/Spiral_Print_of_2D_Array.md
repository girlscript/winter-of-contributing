# **Spiral Print of 2D Array**
Given is the 2D array, print it in spiral form of 2D array.
### **Example :**
```
Input:  1    2   3   4
        5    6   7   8
        9   10  11  12
        13  14  15  16
Output: 1 2 3 4 8 12 16 15 14 13 9 5 6 7 11 10 
Explanation: The output is matrix in spiral format. 

Input:  1   2   3   4  5   6

```

### **Method of approach :**
Draw the path that the spiral makes. We know that the path should turn clockwise whenever it would go out of bounds or into a cell that was previously visited.

### **Algorithm :**

Let the array have R rows and C columns. seen[r] denotes that the cell on the r-th row and c-th column was previously visited. Our current position is (r, c), facing direction di, and we want to visit R x C total cells.

As we move through the matrix, our candidateâ€™s next position is (cr, cc). If the candidate is in the bounds of the matrix and unseen, then it becomes our next position; otherwise, our next position is the one after performing a clockwise turn.

```// Java program for the above approach of Spiral Print of 2D Array
import java.util.*;
 
class Solution {
 
    // Function to print in spiral order
    public static List<Integer> spiralOrder(int[][] matrix)
    {
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<Integer>();
 
        if (matrix.length == 0)
            return ans;
 
        int R = matrix.length, C = matrix[0].length;
        boolean[][] seen = new boolean[R][C];
        int[] dr = { 0, 1, 0, -1 };
        int[] dc = { 1, 0, -1, 0 };
        int r = 0, c = 0, di = 0;
 
        // Iterate from 0 to R * C - 1
        for (int i = 0; i < R * C; i++) {
            ans.add(matrix[r]);
            seen[r] = true;
            int cr = r + dr[di];
            int cc = c + dc[di];
 
            if (0 <= cr && cr < R && 0 <= cc && cc < C
                && !seen[cr][cc]) {
                r = cr;
                c = cc;
            }
            else {
                di = (di + 1) % 4;
                r += dr[di];
                c += dc[di];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
 
    // Driver Code
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int a[][] = { { 1, 2, 3, 4 },
                      { 5, 6, 7, 8 },
                      { 9, 10, 11, 12 },
                      { 13, 14, 15, 16 } };
 
        System.out.println(spiralOrder(a));
    }
}
```
### **Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 8 12 16 15 14 13 9 5 6 7 11 10 
```
### **Complexity Analysis:**
*Time Complexity: O(N)O(N), where NN is the total number of elements in the input matrix. We add every element in the matrix to our final   answer.
*Space Complexity: O(N)O(N), the information stored in seen and in ans.
