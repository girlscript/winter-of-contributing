## Algoritihm Approach

Let the array have R rows and C columns. seen[r] denotes that the cell on the r-th row and c-th column was previously visited. Our current position is (r, c), facing direction di, and we want to visit R x C total cells.

As we move through the matrix, our candidateâ€™s next position is (cr, cc). If the candidate is in the bounds of the matrix and unseen, then it becomes our next position; otherwise, our next position is the one after performing a clockwise turn.

## Intuition


Draw the path that the spiral makes. We know that the path should turn clockwise whenever it would go out of bounds or into a cell that was previously visited.

## Code

```

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> spiralOrder(vector<vector<int> >& matrix)
{
	vector<int> ans;

	if (matrix.size() == 0)
		return ans;

	int R = matrix.size(), C = matrix[0].size();
	vector<vector<bool> > seen(R, vector<bool>(C, false));
	int dr[] = { 0, 1, 0, -1 };
	int dc[] = { 1, 0, -1, 0 };
	int r = 0, c = 0, di = 0;

	// Iterate from 0 to R * C - 1
	for (int i = 0; i < R * C; i++) {
		ans.push_back(matrix[r]);
		seen[r] = true;
		int cr = r + dr[di];
		int cc = c + dc[di];

		if (0 <= cr && cr < R && 0 <= cc && cc < C
			&& !seen[cr][cc]) {
			r = cr;
			c = cc;
		}
		else {
			di = (di + 1) % 4;
			r += dr[di];
			c += dc[di];
		}
	}
	return ans;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	vector<vector<int> > a{ { 1, 2, 3, 4 },
	             { 5, 6, 7, 8 },
							 { 9, 10, 11, 12 },
							 { 13, 14, 15, 16 } };

	for (int x : spiralOrder(a)) {
		cout << x << " ";
	}
	return 0;
}
