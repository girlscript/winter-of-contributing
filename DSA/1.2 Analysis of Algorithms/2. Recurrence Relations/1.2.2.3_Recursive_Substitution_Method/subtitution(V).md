# Solving Recurrence Relations using Substituion Method
This is video explanation on solving Recurrences using Substituion Method.
<br>
There are two ways to solve relations using substitution Method.
- Mathematical Induction
- Backward Substitution (Iterative Method)
<br>
In this video I have shown how to recurrence relations solve using these 2 methods with examples.
