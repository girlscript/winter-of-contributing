# Approximation Algorithm :

An approximation algorithm is a way of dealing with NP-completeness for an optimization problem. 
The goal of the approximation algorithm is to come close as much as possible to the optimal solution in polynomial time.

# Features of Approximation Algorithm :

* An approximation algorithm guarantees to run in polynomial time though it does not guarantee the most effective solution.
* An approximation algorithm guarantees to seek out high accuracy and top quality solution(say within 1% of optimum).
* Approximation algorithms are used to get an answer near the (optimal) solution of an optimization problem in polynomial time.

# Types of Approximation Algorithm :

### 1. The Vertex Cover Problem –
<p> In the vertex cover problem, the optimization problem is to select a minimum number of vertices that should cover all the edges in a graph.
A vertex cover of an undirected graph is a subset of its vertices such that for every edge (u, v) of the graph, either ‘u’ or ‘v’ is in the vertex cover.
Although the name is Vertex Cover, the set covers all edges of the given graph. Given an undirected graph, the vertex cover problem is to find minimum size vertex cover. </p>

The following are some examples.

Vertex Cover Problem is a known NP Complete problem, i.e., there is no polynomial-time solution for this unless P = NP.
There are approximate polynomial-time algorithms to solve the problem though. 

<b> The Time Complexity of the algorithm is O(V + E). </b>
 
### 2. Travelling Salesman Problem –

<p>In the Travelling Salesman Problem, the optimization problem is that the salesman has to take a route that has a minimum cost. Given a set of cities and distances between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point. </p>

For example, consider the graph shown in the figure on the right side. A TSP tour in the graph is 1-2-4-3-1. The cost of the tour is 10+25+30+15 which is 80.
The problem is a famous NP-hard problem. There is no polynomial-time known solution for this problem. 

<b>Traveling salesman problem is a NP-hard problem. Until now, researchers have not found a polynomial time algorithm for traveling salesman problem. Among the existing algorithms, dynamic programming algorithm can solve the problem in time O(n^2*2^n) where n is the number of nodes in the graph. </b>

 
### 3. The Set Covering Problem – 

<p>This is an optimization problem that models many problems that require resources to be allocated. Here, a logarithmic approximation ratio is used.
  Given a universe U of n elements, a collection of subsets of U say S = {S1, S2…,Sm} where every subset Si has an associated cost. Find a minimum cost subcollection of S that covers all elements of U.

</p>
<p>Example :  U = {1,2,3,4,5}
   
  S = {S1,S2,S3}
   
  S1 = {4,1,3},    Cost(S1) = 5
  
  S2 = {2,5},      Cost(S2) = 10
  
  S3 = {1,4,3,2},  Cost(S3) = 3

Output: Minimum cost of set cover is 13 and  set cover is {S2, S3}

There are two possible set covers {S1, S2} with cost 15 and {S2, S3} with cost 13.</p>
 
### 4. The Subset Sum Problem – 

<p>In the Subset sum problem, the optimization problem is to find a subset of {x1,×2,×3…xn} whose sum is as large as possible but not larger than target value t.</p>

<b> 
Time Complexity: O(sum*n), where sum is the ‘target sum’ and ‘n’ is the size of array.
  
Auxiliary Space: O(sum*n), as the size of 2-D array is sum*n.
