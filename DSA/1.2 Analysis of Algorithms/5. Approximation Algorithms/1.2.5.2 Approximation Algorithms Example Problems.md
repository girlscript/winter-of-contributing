## Vertex Cover Problem 

A vertex cover of an undirected graph is a subset of its vertices such that for every edge (u, v) of the graph, either ‘u’ or ‘v’ is in the vertex cover. 
Although the name is Vertex Cover, the set covers all edges of the given graph. Given an undirected graph, the vertex cover problem is to find minimum size vertex cover. 

#### Naive Approach:

Consider all the subset of vertices one by one and find out whether it covers all edges of the graph. For eg. in a graph consisting only 3 vertices the set consisting of the combination of vertices are:{0,1,2,{0,1},{0,2},{1,2},{0,1,2}} . Using each element of this set check whether these vertices cover all  all the edges of the graph. Hence update the optimal answer. And hence print the subset having minimum number of vertices which also covers all the edges of the graph.

#### Approximate Algorithm for Vertex Cover: 
 

1) Initialize the result as {}
2) Consider a set of all edges in given graph.  Let the set be E.
3) Do following while E is not empty
...a) Pick an arbitrary edge (u, v) from set E and add 'u' and 'v' to result
...b) Remove all edges from E which are either incident on u or v.
4) Return result

#### Implementation

    class Graph:

      def __init__(self, vertices):

        # No. of vertices
        self.V = vertices

        # Default dictionary to store graph
        self.graph = defaultdict(list)

      # Function to add an edge to graph
      def addEdge(self, u, v):
        self.graph[u].append(v)

      # The function to print vertex cover
      def printVertexCover(self):

        # Initialize all vertices as not visited.
        visited = [False] * (self.V)

        # Consider all edges one by one
        for u in range(self.V):

          # An edge is only picked when
          # both visited[u] and visited[v]
          # are false
          if not visited[u]:

            # Go through all adjacents of u and
            # pick the first not yet visited
            # vertex (We are basically picking
            # an edge (u, v) from remaining edges.
            for v in self.graph[u]:
              if not visited[v]:
                visited[v] = True
                visited[u] = True
    
        for j in range(self.V):
          if visited[j]:
            print(j, end = ' ')

        print()
    g = Graph(7)
    g.addEdge(0, 1)
    g.addEdge(0, 2)
    g.addEdge(1, 3)
    g.addEdge(3, 4)
    g.addEdge(4, 5)
    g.addEdge(5, 6)

    g.printVertexCover()

    Output: 

    0 1 3 4 5 6
   
The Time Complexity of the above algorithm is O(V + E).

## Travelling Salesman Problem

Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.
Note the difference between Hamiltonian Cycle and TSP. The Hamiltoninan cycle problem is to find if there exist a tour that visits every city exactly once. Here we know that Hamiltonian Tour exists (because the graph is complete) and in fact many such tours exist, the problem is to find a minimum weight Hamiltonian Cycle.

#### Naive Solution:
1) Consider city 1 as the starting and ending point.
2) Generate all (n-1)! Permutations of cities.
3) Calculate cost of every permutation and keep track of minimum cost permutation.
4) Return the permutation with minimum cost.

Time Complexity: Θ(n!)

#### Dynamic Programming

If size of S is 2, then S must be {1, i},
 C(S, i) = dist(1, i) 
Else if size of S is greater than 2.
 C(S, i) = min { C(S-{i}, j) + dis(j, i)} where j belongs to S, j != i and j != 1.

There are at most O(n*2n) subproblems, and each one takes linear time to solve. The total running time is therefore O(n2*2n).
The time complexity is much less than O(n!), but still exponential. Space required is also exponential. So this approach is also infeasible even for slightly higher number of vertices.

## Set Cover Problem

Given a universe U of n elements, a collection of subsets of U say S = {S1, S2…,Sm} where every subset Si has an associated cost. Find a minimum cost subcollection of S that covers all elements of U.

    U = {1,2,3,4,5}
     S = {S1,S2,S3}

     S1 = {4,1,3},    Cost(S1) = 5
     S2 = {2,5},      Cost(S2) = 10
     S3 = {1,4,3,2},  Cost(S3) = 3

    Output: Minimum cost of set cover is 13 and 
            set cover is {S2, S3}

There are two possible set covers {S1, S2} with cost 15
and {S2, S3} with cost 13.


#### Approximate Greedy Algorithm:

    Let U be the universe of elements, {S1, S2, … Sm} be collection of subsets of U and Cost(S1), C(S2), … Cost(Sm) be costs of subsets.

    1) Let I represents set of elements included so far.  Initialize I = {}

    2) Do following while I is not same as U.
        a) Find the set Si in {S1, S2, ... Sm} whose cost effectiveness is 
           smallest, i.e., the ratio of cost C(Si) and number of newly added 
           elements is minimum. 
           Basically we pick the set for which following value is minimum.
               Cost(Si) / |Si - I|
        b) Add elements of above picked Si to I, i.e.,  I = I U Si




Time Complexity: O(sum*n), where sum is the ‘target sum’ and ‘n’ is the size of array.
Auxiliary Space: O(sumn), as the size of 2-D array is sumn.
