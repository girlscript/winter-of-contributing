## What is Approximation Algorithm ?

An approximation algorithm is a way of dealing with NP-completeness for an optimization problem. The goal of the approximation algorithm is to come close as much as possible to the optimal solution in polynomial time.


### Features of Approximation Algorithm 

**Here, we will discuss the features of the Approximation Algorithm as follows.**

* An approximation algorithm guarantees to run in polynomial time though it does not guarantee the most effective solution.
* An approximation algorithm guarantees to seek out high accuracy and top-quality solution(say within 1% of optimum)
* Approximation algorithms are used to get an answer near the (optimal) solution of an optimization problem in polynomial time
