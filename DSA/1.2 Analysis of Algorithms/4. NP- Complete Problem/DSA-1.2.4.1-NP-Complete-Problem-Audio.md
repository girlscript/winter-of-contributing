# Brief summary on the audio clip :

It contains what is np-completeness and what are np,p, np-complete and np-hard problems . What they are ,their time complexities and differences and similarity.

# Concludingly :

    1. P-problems : quick to slove.
    2. NP- problems : quick to verify but slow to solve .
    3. NP-Complete problems : quick to verify , slow to solve and can be reduced to any other np-complete problems .
    4. NP-Hard problems: slow to verify , slow to solve but can be reduced to any other np problems.
