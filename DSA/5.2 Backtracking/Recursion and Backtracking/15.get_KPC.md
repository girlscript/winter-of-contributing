<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion : </b></i>

Now let's discuss "WHAT" the question says. You can also refer to the question link given below to analyze the given question.

This is a test that checks if you are a millennial. Do you remember the Nokia mobiles with buttons and how difficult it was to send a single SMS to your lover? Yeah, take that silly grin off your face.We are going to explore your past today.

We are given a key to the character map in Figure 1. Let's see through an example what we have to do:

If we are given an input of 573, then :

This is how the mapping of characters should take place according to the list given in the question.

Here the total number of combinations will be : 4 x 2 x 3=24 , where 4, 3 and 2 are the number of characters corresponding to each element of the input string.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach : </b></i>

Let's understand the approach through High Level Thinking using the above example of 573.

<i><b>Set Expectation : </b></i>

We expect that if we take a string, say, "573" , then the output should be as shown in Figure 2 .

<i><b>Build Faith : </b></i>

We must have faith that if our code can give us an output for string "573", then it can definitely give us an output for string "73". 

You just need to believe. Don't focus on "HOW" that will happen.

<i><b>Expectation meets Faith : </b></i>

For printing the desired keypad combinations for string "573", "5" will manifest itself as m/n/o/p , and we add each of these characters for "5" to every output of "73".

Before going further, we recommend you to watch the "Get Subsequence" Solution video if you haven't already because the logic behind both the questions is the same.

Now take a look at the following code:

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    String str = scn.next();
    ArrayList< String> words = getKPC(str);
    System.out.println(words);
  }
  static String[] codes = {".;", "abc", "def", "ghi", "jkl", "mno", "pqrs", "tu", "vwx",
                           "yz"
                          };                                                        //#

  public static ArrayList< String> getKPC(String str) {
    if (str.length() == 0) {                                  //1
      ArrayList< String>bres = new ArrayList< >();
      bres.add("");
      return bres;
    }

    char ch = str.charAt(0);                                      //2
    String ros = str.substring(1);                                //3
    ArrayList< String>rres = getKPC(bc);                           //4
    ArrayList< String> mres = new ArrayList< >();

    String codeforch = codes[ch - "0"];                           //5

    for (int i = 0; i < codeforch.length(); i++) {
      char chcode = codeforch.charAt(i);
      for (String val : rres) {                                   //6
        mres.add(chcode + val);
      }
    }
    return mres;                                                  //7
  }

}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Code Discussion </b></i>

We form a global array of strings called "codes" which store the key to character elements where key is the index of the element and characters are the characters of the string at that index.

<i><b>Base Case: </b></i>

If the string length reaches 0, then a new ArrayList bres is created .A blank is added to it and it is returned.

We separate the first element i.e. "5" of the given string and store it in char ch.

Next we store the remaining part of the given string i.e "73" in the string ros.

The function getKPC is recursively called on ros and we have faith that it will provide us the keypad combinations for string "73".

In coding , "6" != 6 . The former is a character 6 and latter is an integer 6. So to convert a character into an integer we write the given code.

We apply a for loop for every keypad combination of "73" which is stored in rres and then add each character corresponding to "5" to every output of "73". This is eventually added in our final ArrayList mres.

At last, we return our final ArrayList mres where the output for "573" is stored.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis </b></i>

Reader, we have moved on to the Low Level Thinking of the problem. Let's dry run our code in 2 parts. The numbers on the left side of the figures represent the code lines that have been run( refer to the above code).

<i><b>While going up the path </b></i>

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_kpc/get_kpc_4.png">

As we discussed in the code , we separate 5 and 73 and recursively call the function on 73.

Again, 73 gets separated into 7 and 3 and a recursion call on 3 is made.
Then in the next recursive call, 3 is stored in ch but ros is a blank ,so a call is made on an empty string.

Due to the base case , we know that a blank string returns an ArrayList with a blank element.

<i><b>While going down the path </b></i>

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_kpc/get_kpc_5.png">

A blank is returned to "3" and using the for loop ,the characters corresponding to 3 are added to the output . Then //7 runs and the previous output is returned to 73. This goes on until the recursive call moves back to "573".

Then finally all the keypad combinations for 573 are printed.
This method can be used to solve the input given in the question too.

<i><b>Time Complexity : </b></i>
O(n)

This time complexity is linear because a recursion call is made along with using "for loop".

<i><b>Space Complexity : </b></i>
O(1)

As no extra space is required, therefore space complexity is constant. However, if we include the space used in the recursive stack then the space complexity is O(n).

We hope that you understood the concept of Recursion successfully. In case you still face any difficulties in the solution for the problem, you may visit the complete solution [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjt19bjs3A&t=1009s).

Happy Coding!
