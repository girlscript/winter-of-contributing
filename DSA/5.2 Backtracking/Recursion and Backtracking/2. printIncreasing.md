<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

In the problem as mentioned, a positive number n is given. You are required to print the counting from 1 to n.

It seems to be a pretty simple question, but as mentioned you are supposed to not use any loops, therefore use recursion.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

Taking an example, let say that we pass 5 as input then we need to print:

(1 2 3 4 5) in different lines. We will use the same concepts as we discussed previously. YES!

Let"s revisit all those concepts of High level thinking and Low level thinking.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>High level thinking has three parts: </b></i>

i) Expectation

ii) Faith

iii) How to meet Expectation with Faith

With high level thinking, we can figure out our basic code.

Then coming to low level thinking, we need to dry run our code and try to look at the stack frame after each recursive call. This helps us to identify our base case.

And with both high and low level thinking, we will finally get our code. Continuing with our example, for n = 5, let"s define our expectation and faith.

<i><b>Expectation: </b></i>

Our expectation from PrintIncreasing(n) is that if we pass n = 5, it will give us desired output: (1  2  3  4  5 )

<i><b>Faith: </b></i>

Our faith from PrintIncreasing(n-1) i.e. PrintIncreasing(4) in this case, is that it will print (1  2  3  4 ) for sure.
To meet this expectation with faith, what can we do?

Well, if you look at the expected output of PrintIncreasing(5) i.e. (1  2  3  4  5 ) and at PrintIncreasing(4) i.e. (1  2  3  4 ) then it can be observed that there is just the difference of 5. 

So, we can call PrintIncreasing(4), which will print (1  2  3  4 ) and then our job will be to simply print 5

Let"s generalize it for n, PrintIncreasing(n) is a function which is required to print counting from 1 to n. We believe that PrintIncreasing(n-1) will print counting from 1 to n - 1. Therefore, we call PrintIncreasing(n-1), and then print n.

Let"s code this part for now:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_increasing/print_increasing_6.png">

Now, as we are done with the High Level Thinking part i.e. with the basic code. Moving to the Low level Thinking, lets dry run the basic code and find out the base case.

As shown in the figure, initially, the first call is received from main, all the statements of main before calling PrintIncreasing(5), gets executed.

When PrintIncreasing(5) is called, it is pushed to the top of the stack. Then the first statement of this function gets executed which further calls PrintIncreasing(4) which then gets pushed on the top of the stack.

Similarly, this process continues till PrintIncreasing(0), until we realize that we don"t even need to print "0". Also, this code will give us stack overflow, as the function call will keep calling itself with a decremented value.

But with this error, we can successfully build our base case. Which will be, whenever, the value of n becomes 0 then we can simply return the function before letting it make further calls.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_increasing/print_increasing_8.png">

We need to add this statement at the top of the function, before the control goes to the next statement, which is recursive in nature.

Let"s look at our revised function code:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_increasing/print_increasing_9.png">

Yes, now that looks complete!

Let"s quickly dry run this code.

As shown in the (figure-1), initially, the first call is received from main, and all the statements of main before calling PrintIncreasing(5), gets executed.

When PrintIncreasing(5) is called, it is pushed to the top of the stack. Then the first statement of this function gets executed. 

Condition n == 0 is checked, which is false, so now control comes to the second statement. Which further calls PrintIncreasing(4) which is now pushed on the top of the stack.

Similarly, this process continues till PrintIncreasing(0).
Reaching here, when the first statement executes, checking for n == 0, which is true. Next, the return statement executes.

So control now comes back to the PrintIncreasing(1).

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_increasing/print_increasing_10.png">

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_increasing/print_increasing_11.png">

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_increasing/print_increasing_12.png">

After returning to PrintIncreasing(1), control comes back to the next statement i.e. 3rd, which finally prints the number "1". Now control returns to the PrintIncreasing(2) and the next statement gets executed, printing the number "2".

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_increasing/print_increasing_13.png">

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_increasing/print_increasing_14.png">

Similar way control comes back to the PrintIncreasing(3) and the next statement gets executed, printing the number "3".

Now control returns to the PrintIncreasing(4) and the next statement gets executed, printing the number "4".

Finally, control returns to the PrintIncreasing(5) and the next statement gets executed, printing the number "5".

At last, control returns to the main.

Yes, we are done now!

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    printDecreasing(n);
  }

  public static void printIncreasing(int n) {
    if (n == 0) //Base case
      return;
    printDecreasing(n - 1);//Recursive call
    System.out.println(n);//Self Work

  }

}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis </b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>
O(n)

As n calls are made and work is done corresponding to these n calls therefore the time complexity becomes O(n).

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>
O(1)

Since no extra space is used, therefore space complexity is constant, however you should know that if the recursion call stack is taken into account, then space complexity will be O(n) as there are n recursive calls.

We hope that you understood the concept of Recursion successfully. In case you still face any difficulties in the solution for the problem, you may visit the complete solution [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5IobAWmfjQ&list=TLGGTCWSVlXgiLkxNjA2MjAyMQ).

Happy Coding!
