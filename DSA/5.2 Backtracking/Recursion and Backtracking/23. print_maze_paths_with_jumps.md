<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

Now, let us discuss the question once. Have a look at the diagram shown below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_maze_path_with_jumps/print_maze_path_with_jumps_1.png">

We will be given an nxm matrix as in (fig-1) we are given a 5x4 matrix. We are initially at starting position M[1][1]. 

We have to reach the final position i.e. M[5][4]. For doing that we can take three types of steps

<i><b>Vertical Steps: </b></i>

We can move down in the column by any number of steps that we want to. 

For instance, from M[1][1] we may move just a single step to M[2][1] or we may move 2 steps and go directly to M[3][1] or in fact, we may directly move from M[1][1] to M[5][1].

<i><b>Horizontal Steps: </b></i>

We can move in the forward direction within the same row and we may move by as many steps as we want. 

For instance, from M[1][1] we may move one step to M[1][2] or two steps to M[1][3] or we may directly jump from M[1][1] to M[1][4].

<i><b>Diagonal Steps: </b></i>

We can also move along the diagonal and we may take as many steps as we want to. For instance, from M[1][1], we may move to M[2][2] or M[3][3] or even directly to M[4][4].

<i><b>Remember: </b></i>

This problem is to print all the paths and not to store them. In the "GET" version of the same problem we stored the paths in an Arraylist, but here we just have to print the paths. 

You may refer to the question video if you have any doubts regarding the question. Try to solve the problem on your own as you already know most of the logic already. Don't worry, we have discussed the complete logic in this article. So, even if you have not solved this problem previously, you are going to understand every bit of it from scratch.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

Exploring all the options: First of all, let us try to decide what exactly we are going to do. Have a look at the diagram shown below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_maze_path_with_jumps/print_maze_path_with_jumps_2.png">

We are given this matrix and we have to reach the destination. We have understood the question and we know that we can move any number of valid steps in horizontal vertical and diagonal directions. Have a look at (fig-3) shown below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_maze_path_with_jumps/print_maze_path_with_jumps_3.png">

Note that this diagram does not represent every possibility where M[1][1] can go. We start from M[1][1] and we can reach many spots from M[1][1]. 

Some of them are shown in the diagram. But we know that we need to find all the spots that can be reached from our initial spot so that we can call our function recursively on each of those spots and print all the paths. So, let's try to do that first. 

Let's try to find out all the possible spots.

<i><b>Finding all Initial Spots Along the Row:</b></i>

Look at the diagram given below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_maze_path_with_jumps/print_maze_path_with_jumps_4.png">

The diagram above shows all the possible destinations that we can reach directly from M[1][1] along the row. So in general, for any matrix of size nxm we can have these initial spots along the row:

M[1][1], M[1][2], M[1][3],.....M[1][c].

<i><b>Maximum Number Of Moves Along a Row: </b></i>

If we think in terms of the number of moves that we can make in this direction, you can see that the maximum possible move is of size 5. 

Now, this is not just for the initial row rather it is for every row. Assume we took 1 vertical step first. 

So now we are at M[2][1], so what are the maximum possible moves in the direction of this row? (It will be the same as that for the initial row and it will be the same for every row).

To move along a row, we are changing the columns while remaining in the same row. 

Now, the starting point of any row is actually sc i.e. the source column=1 and the endpoint of a row is the last column or the dc i.e. destination column (which is=6 in the above diagram).

So, the maximum possible moves that we can make and also the max possible size of move/jump that we can make along a row is (dc-sc) which is 6-1=5.

<i><b>Finding all initial spots along the column:</b></i>

Look at the diagram given below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_maze_path_with_jumps/print_maze_path_with_jumps_6.png">

We are at M[1][1] at the beginning of our problem. We can either move to M[2][1] by 1 step or we may directly move 2,3 or even 4 steps forward. So, the initial spots along the column are:

M[1][1], M[2][1], M[3][1] and M[4][1].

In general, for a matrix with n number of rows:

M[1][1], M[2][1],.....M[n][1].

<i><b>Maximum Number Of moves along a Column:</b></i>

If we think in terms of the number of moves that we can make in this direction, you can see that the maximum possible move is of size 4. Now, this is not just for the initial column rather it is for every column. 

Assume we took 1 horizontal step first. So now we are at M[1][2], so what are the maximum possible moves in the direction of this column? (It will be the same as that for the initial column and it will be the same for every column).

To move along a column, we are changing the rows while remaining in the same column. Now, the starting point of any column is actually sr i.e. the source row=1, and the endpoint of a column is the last row or the dr i.e. destination row(which is=5 in the above diagram).

So, the maximum possible moves that we can make and also the max possible size of move/jump that we can make along a column is (dr-sr) which is 5-1=4.

<i><b>Finding all Initial spots along the diagonal:</b></i>

Have a look at the diagram shown below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_maze_path_with_jumps/print_maze_path_with_jumps_8.png">

We start from M[1][1] and we can either go to M[2][2] by taking 1 jump or we may go to M[3][3] by taking a jump of size=2. So the initial spots along the diagonal are:

M[1][1], M[2][2], M[3][3] and M[4][4].

In general, if a matrix is of order nxm where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns then:

If n>m:

Initial Spots: M[1][1..M[m][m]

Else if m>=n:

Initial spots: M[1][1]....M[n][n]

Also, the max size of a jump will depend on the same factor. If rows n>m then the max possible size of jumps will be the same as the size of jump of m else it will be the same as the size of jump of n

<i><b>Going to another Level:</b></i>

So, now we know how to move in the matrix and we also believe that recursion will give us the path till destination from the spot we are currently on. We will move to another level automatically by the recursive call.

<i><b>Reaching the Base Case:</b></i>

As discussed earlier, in the levels and options method, when we reach the base case, we get our answer. 

That is why this is called as recursion while going up as we are exploring all the possibilities and moving up in the recursion towards the base case, where we get our answer. 

Let's try to reach the base case and understand the recursion using Euler Tree.

Look at the matrix given below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_maze_path_with_jumps/print_maze_path_with_jumps_9.png">

This is a 2x3 matrix. If we dry run the above code for this matrix we will get a Euler tree as follows:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_maze_path_with_jumps/print_maze_path_with_jumps_10.png">

We started from M[1][1]. Then, we enter the loop of horizontal rows and a recursive call starts for tracing the path (refer to the code side by side). 

From M[1][1] we move to M[1][2] on a recursive call. We have moved "h1" i.e. one horizontal step and the recursive call is again made in the horizontal direction and we move to M[1][3]. Now after M[1][3] we do not have any element in that row. 

So, a recursive call for horizontal direction cannot be made. So, the vertical call was made and for that, we went to M[2][3] which is the destination. 

Note: We have not shown any invalid calls in the Euler tree like the horizontal call and the diagonal call made for M[2][3]. 

So, we can very clearly understand that the base case for this recursion is when we reach our destination i.e. when row=dr (destination row) and column=dc (destination column). Obviously, we knew this was going to be the base case, right?

But, don't forget that we also have to print the path when the base case is reached. 

We request you to trace the Euler path and draw the Euler tree yourself to understand the concept in-depth.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>

The time complexity of this procedure is O(3m+n) where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the matrix. We have discussed the derivation of this complexity in GET MAZE PATHS WITH JUMPS ARTICLE. You may refer to the article to know how the time complexity is derived.

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>

The space complexity of this procedure is O(1) since we have not used any extra memory or any extra data structure.

So dear reader, did you get this problem completely? We recommend you again to solve the GET MAZE PATHS WITH JUMPS problem as well. We also recommend you to watch its complete solution video and the complete solution video of this problem to clear the difference between the "get" and "print" problems in general.
