<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

As mentioned in the problem you are given a number n and a number m representing the number of rows and columns in a maze. 

Suppose you are standing in the top-left corner and have to reach the bottom-right corner. Only two moves are allowed, "h" (1-step horizontal) and "v" (1-step vertical). 

We need to complete the body of printMazePath function - without changing signature - to print the list of all paths that can be used to move from top-left to bottom-right.

<i><b>Note -> </b></i>The online judge can"t force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is. 
Write recursive and not iterative logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.

For example:

<i><b>Sample Input:</b></i>
```
2

```
<i><b>Sample Output:</b></i>

```
hv
vh
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

We will be using the trick, "Levels and option" for solving this problem. 

In this trick, we explore all the options at a particular level. 

Not ignoring the signature which solves half of our problem already (public static void printMazePaths(int sr, int sc, int dr, int dc, String psf)). 

Analysing the parameters we have sr (starting row), sc (starting column), dr (destination row), dc(destination column), and a string psf (path so far).

Let's assume that Mayank is standing at the top left corner (source) of the square floor of 3x3. And he needs to reach the bottom right corner (destination).

But since he is allowed to take only one step in either vertical or horizontal direction, let's look at how he reaches his destination.

When Mayank is at Source (1,1), he has two options, he can either move vertically down(2,1) or horizontally right(1,2) by one step.

If he decides to move horizontally right, then he reaches (1,2), where again he has two choices, either moving vertically down (2,2)or horizontally right(1,3) by one step.

If he again decides to move horizontally right, then he reaches (1,3), where he has only one choice, i.e. moving vertically down (2,3) because moving horizontally right(1,4 say) by one step takes him out of the box.

After moving to (2,3), again he has only one choice, i.e. moving vertically down (3,3) because moving horizontally right(2,4 say) by one step takes him out of the box.

So, Mayank finally reaches the destination using one of the options at each level.

Similarly, if he decides to choose any other option at any level he may discover a new path.

All these possibilities are explored in the figure below.
So, while coding we need to keep in my mind that at every level he has two options to explore, one horizontally right, changing the parameters to (sc + 1) and updating psf by concatenating a "h" in psf and other vertically down, changing the parameters to (sr + 1) and updating psf by concatenating a "v" in psf. Therefore, two recursion calls will be made.

And whenever we reach the destination i.e. when sr == dr and sc == dc we need to print our psf and return the function.

Does that look complete? Think of it!

No, it is not complete. Remember that when Mayank used to move out of the box because that was the next possible option to explore. But to stop Mayank from moving out of the box, we need to warn him. So when (sr > dr) or (sc >dc) we need to simply return.

Yes, that looks complete!

    if (sr > dr || sc > dc) {
      return;
    }

    if (sr == dr && sc == dc) {
      System.out.println(psf);
      return;
    }

    printMazePaths(sr, sc + 1, dr, dc, psf + "h");
    printMazePaths(sr + 1, sc, dr, dc, psf + "v");

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>
O(2^n)

The time complexity of this procedure is O(2^n*m) where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the matrix.

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>
O(1)

The space complexity of this procedure is O(1) since we have not used any extra memory or any extra data structure.

So reader, we hope that this article was helpful. We used a combined approach here that we used in "Get Maze Path" and "Print Subsequence". In case you still face any difficulties in the solution for the problem, you may visit the complete solution [video](https://youtu.be/MHtAA5UE-6Y).

Don't lose hope whenever you get lost during understanding.

Keep practicing more questions on recursion!

We will see you soon in the next problem. Until then keep learning.

Happy coding!
