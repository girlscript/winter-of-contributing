<i style="text-decoration"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>
You are given an array of n numbers and a number "tar" as the input.
You have to calculate and print all subsets of the given elements, the contents of which sum to "tar".
Say, if you are given an array 10,20,30,40,50 and the target is 60. Then all the valid subsets are [10,20,30],[10,50] and [20,40].

We want you to try to think of an algorithm for this question.

*Hint: When you reach the base case you would already have a subset with you. Check whether the sum of that subset is equal to the target.

An array of n elements has 2n subsets. It is so because every element has an option of whether to be included or not in that subset.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

<i><b>RECURSION TREE</b></i>

We try to make a recursion tree for finding the subsets for a smaller array [10, 20, 30] where the target is 30 as you can see in figure 1.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/target_sum_subsets/target_sum_subsets_1.png">

We'll explain this tree to you now.

At each vertex we have kept 3 entities: [element |subset |sum].

Our first element of the array is "10".

Initially, it has no subsets and hence the sum is 0.

Now it has 2 options, to be included or not. For the time being we are calling these options as YES and NO respectively.

When 10 goes to the YES part then, we have moved on to element 20. Till now the subset consists of only 10 and consequently the sum is also 10.

Had 10 moved to the NO part then no subset would have been formed and hence the sum would have remained 0.

These YES and NO parts of 10 each branch out to give 2 choices of 20 further. Hence we keep doing so until all the elements of the array have been used up.

Now that we have found the sum of all the subsets in the last level of the tree, we print those subsets only where the sum=30.

You can also watch the YouTube video "Target Sum Subsets" to know how this tree is built with a much clearer understanding.

[video](https://youtu.be/HGDmj5NrrjM).

Let's write a code for it.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    int[]arr = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      arr[i] = scn.nextInt();
    }
    int tar = scn.nextInt();
    printTargetSumSubsets(arr, 0, "", 0, tar);      //1

  }

  // set is the subset
  // sos is sum of subset
  // tar is target
  public static void printTargetSumSubsets(int[] arr, int idx, String set, int sos, int tar) {

    if (idx == arr.length) { //2
      if (sos == tar) {
        System.out.println(set + ".");
      }
      return;
    }

    printTargetSumSubsets(arr, idx + 1, set + arr[idx] + ", ", sos + arr[idx], tar); //3
    printTargetSumSubsets(arr, idx + 1, set, sos, tar); //4



  }

}
```

<i><b>CODE DISCUSSION</b></i>

Now we will explain this code.

We pass the following arguments as parameters to the given function "PrintTarget SumSubsets" : given input array, the index we are at i.e. 0 , initial empty subset, sum of that subset and the target .

<i><b>BASE CASE:</b></i> 

We check whether the index is equal to array of length because it would tell us whether all the elements have been used up or not.

<i><b>NOTE: </b></i>

Here we check condition for arr.length and not arr.length-1 even though the indices start with 0 because when the recursive function is called on the last element it increases the index by 1 for the index arr.length-1 and hence the value stored in "idx" is equal to the arr.length.

We call a recursive function for the YES part of the element. Here, that element gets added to the subset string and arithmetically added to "sos".

Next, we call a recursive function for the NO part of that element. Here, that element does not get added to either the subset string or the "sos".

When we run this code it gives us our desired output .

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>
O(2n)

This time complexity is exponential because for each state, 2 recursion calls are made.

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>
O(1)

As no extra space is required, therefore space complexity is constant. However, if we include the space used in the recursive stack then the space complexity is O(n).

Here, we conclude our question "Target Sum Subsets" by Recursion. In the further sections you will see more approaches to solve this problem like using Dynamic Programming. But you don't need to worry about that right now.

For now we bid you Goodbye.
