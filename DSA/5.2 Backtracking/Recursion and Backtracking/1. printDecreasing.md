<h1><i><b>Introduction to Recursion</b></i></h1>

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>What is Recursion?</b></i>

In simple words, a function is said to be recursive if it calls itself.

Before we jump into the depth of recursion, let's try to see some connection between <i><b>Math</b></i> and <i><b>Programming</b></i>:

<i><b>Functions:</b></i>

i) Assume that in Math, there is a function, f(x) = x^2. 

We can also write a code for this function using Programming.
    <i><b>Fun(int x){ return x*x;</b></i>

ii) In math, we use this function by substituting value for x, e.g. <i><b>f(2) = 2^2 = 2*2 =4.</b></i>

Incidentally, we use a similar approach in programming. 

We can call the function in main for x = 2 as: int x = Fun(2).

What we basically want you to explain is that both the methods are quite similar. And functions are just a way to express algebra in programming.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>PMI: Principle of Mathematical Induction</b></i>

I think it's been a while since you last studied this concept. Let's sneak into it quickly.

In this, we were given a formula and our aim was to prove the given formula.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_decreasing/print_decreasing_1.png">

Steps followed to prove the formula are as follow:

Check whether the formula is true for n = 1, i.e., P(1) is true.
If true, then we assume that the formula is true for n = k.
Then we need to prove that the formula is also true for n = k + 1.

I hope that you understand this PMI problem. It is important to note that we use similar steps to approach a recursion problem. We will discuss these steps through our problem, "Print Decreasing".

<i><b>Question Link : </b></i>[Click](https://www.pepcoding.com/resources/online-java-foundation/introduction-to-recursion/print-decreasing-official/ojquestion).

Taking an example, let us say that we pass 5 as input then we need to print:(5 4 3 2 1) in different lines.

Recursion has two stages, <i><b>High level thinking</b></i> and <i><b>Low level thinking.</b></i>

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_decreasing/print_decreasing_3.png">

High level thinking has three parts:

i) Expectation

ii) Faith

iii) How to meet Expectation with Faith

With high level thinking, we can figure out our basic code. Then coming to low level thinking, we need to dry run our code and try to look at the stack frame after each recursive call. This helps us to identify our base case.

And with both high and low level thinking, we will finally get our code.

Continuing with our example, for n = 5, let's define our expectation and faith.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_decreasing/print_decreasing_4.png">

<i><b>Expectation: </b></i>

Our expectation from PrintDecreasing(n) is that if we pass n = 5, it will give us desired output: (5 4 3 2 1)

<i><b>Faith: </b></i>

Our faith from PrintDecreasing(n-1) i.e. PrintDecreasing(4) in this case, is that it will print (4 3 2 1) for sure.

At this point you may raise an objection that, How can we assume anything like that? But my friend, have FAITH in you, in us and in PrintDecreasing(4).

To meet this expectation with faith, what can we do?

Well, if you look at the expected output of PrintDecreasing(5) i.e. (5 4 3 2 1) and at PrintIDecreasing(4) i.e. (4 3 2 1) then it can be observed that there is just the difference of 5. So, we can print "5" and then call PrintDecreasing(4), which will print (1 2 3 4) , which seems to give us our output.
PrintDecreasing(5) { Print(5) PrintDecreasing(4) }

int [] marks; this is the declaration of array

Let's generalize it for n, PrintDecreasing(n) is a function which is required to print counting from n to 1. We believe that PrintDecreasing(n-1) will print counting from n-1 to 1. Therefore, we first print n and then call PrinDencreasing(n-1), which prints the rest of the counting.
PrintDecreasing(n) { Print(n) PrintDecreasing (n-1) }

Let's code this part for now:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_decreasing/print_decreasing_6.png">

Now, as we are done with the High Level Thinking part i.e. with the basic code. Moving to the Low level Thinking, lets dry run the basic code and find out the base case.

Let's look into the <i><b>stack frame</b></i>:

As shown in the figure, initially, the first call is received from main, all the statements of main before calling PrintDecreasing(5), get executed.

When PrintDecreasing(5) is called, it is pushed to the top of the stack. Then the first statement of this function gets executed which prints "5"further calling PrintDecreasing(4).

PrintDecreasing(4), which then gets pushed on the top of the stack. First statement of this function gets executed which prints "4", further calling PrintDecreasing(3) which then gets pushed on the top of the stack.

Similarly, this process continues till PrintDecreasing(0), where the first statement gets executed printing "0", until we realize that we don't even need to print "0". 

Also, this code will give us stack overflow, as the function call will keep calling itself with a decremented value.

Now knowing this error, we can successfully build our base case. Which will be, whenever, the value of n becomes 0 then we can simply return the function before letting it make further calls.

We need to add this statement at the top of the function, before any other statement (recursive call) gets executed.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_decreasing/print_decreasing_8.png">

Let's look at our revised function code:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_decreasing/print_decreasing_9.png">

Yes, now that looks complete!

As shown in the (figure-1), initially, the first call is received from main, and all the statements of main before calling PrintDecreasing(5), get executed.

When PrintDecreasing(5) is called, it is pushed to the top of the stack. Then the first statement of this function gets executed. Condition n == 0 is checked, which is false, so now control comes to the second statement, which prints "5". 

Then third statement gets executed, which further calls PrintDecreasing(4) which is now pushed on the top of the stack.
When PrintDecreasing(4) is called, it is pushed to the top of the stack. 

Then the first statement of this function gets executed. Condition n == 0 is checked, which is false, so now control comes to the second statement, which prints "4". 

Then third statement gets executed, which further calls PrintDecreasing(3) which is now pushed on the top of the stack.
When PrintDecreasing(4) is called, it is pushed to the top of the stack. 

Then the first statement of this function gets executed. Condition n == 0 is checked, which is false, so now control comes to the second statement, which prints "4".

Then third statement gets executed, which further calls PrintDecreasing(3) which is now pushed on the top of the stack.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_decreasing/print_decreasing_10.png">

Similar steps repeat when, when PrintDecreasing(3), PrintDecreasing(2) and PrintDecreasing(1) are pushed into stack one after other respectively and printing "3", "2" and "1".

When the PrintDecreasing(1) calls PrintDecreasing(0), the condition check n==0, becomes true and the return statement executes, returning the control to PrintDecreasing(1).
PrintDecreasing(0) gets wiped out of the stack. And control comes back to the PrintDecreasing(1).

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_decreasing/print_decreasing_11.png">

In figure-2, 3 and 4 you can see how the function PrintDecreasing(0), PrintDecreasing(1) and PrintDecreasing(2) get wiped out of the stack.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_decreasing/print_decreasing_12.png">

In figure-5, 6 and 7 you can see how the function PrintDecreasing(3), PrintDecreasing(4) and finally PrintDecreasing(5) gets wiped out of the stack.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity: </b></i>O(n)

As n calls are made and work is done corresponding to these n calls therefore the time complexity becomes O(n).

<i><b>Space Complexity: </b></i>O(1)

Since no extra space is used, therefore space complexity is constant, however you should know that if the recursion call stack is taken into account, then space complexity will be O(n) as there are n recursive calls.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    printDecreasing(n);
  }

  public static void printDecreasing(int n) {
    //Base case
    if (n == 0)
      return;

    //Self Work
    System.out.println(n);

    //Recursive call
```
