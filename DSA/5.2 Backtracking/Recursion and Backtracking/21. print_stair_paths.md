<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

As mentioned in our problem you are given a number n representing the number of stairs in a staircase. You are standing at the bottom of the staircase. 

And you are allowed to climb 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps in one move.

We need to complete the body of printStairPaths function - without changing signature - to print the list of all paths that can be used to climb the staircase up.

<i><b>Note -> </b></i>

The online judge can"t force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is. Write recursive and not iterative logic. 

The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.

For example:

<i><b>Sample Input: </b></i>
```
3
```

<i><b>Sample Output: </b></i>
```
1  1  1 
1  2 
2  1 
3 
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

We will be using the trick, "Levels and option" for solving this problem. Let's assume that Gautam needs to climb up a stair of 4 steps.

When standing on the ground, he has 3 options that he can climb to Step 1, Step 2 or Step 3 of the stair using 1, 2 or 3 steps respectively.

If he uses option 1 then he will reach successfully to Step 1 and now he has again 3 options to climb up that is to Step 2, Step 3 or Step 4 of the stair using 1, 2 or 3 steps respectively.

If he uses option 1 again then he will reach successfully to Step 2 but this time he has only 2 options to climb up that is to Step 3 or Step 4 of the stair using 1 or 2 steps respectively.

If he uses option 1 again then he will successfully reach Step 3 but this time he has only 1 option to climb up that is to Step 4 of the stair using 1 step.

Following the above mentioned options, Gautam finally reaches Step 4, using the steps (1-1-1-1).

What we discussed above, was just one of the options that Gautam explored. If at any steps he decides to choose a different option to reach Step 4 then the path he follows now will differ from the above explored path as we can see in the figure.

Let's try to code this function with the given signature, printStairsPath(int n, String psf), where n is the input given by the user. And psf (path so far), is an empty String in which we collect our result.

Checks if n is less than or equal to 0. If this condition is true then control goes to the next //2 statement.

Checks if n is equal to 0. If this condition is true then control goes to the next //3 statement.
Prints the psf (Path so far).

Returns the control to the previous function or main.
Makes a recursive call for exploring all the paths when 1 step is taken.

Makes a recursive call for exploring all the paths when 2 steps are taken.

Makes a recursive call for exploring all the paths when 2 steps are taken.

I hope that you understand the function code. In case it is not clear then you can also watch our solution [video](https://youtu.be/NEuYcztalew) part.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int t = scn.nextInt();
    printStairPaths(n, "");
  }

  public static void printStairPaths(int n, String psf) {
    if (n <= 0) {
      if (n == 0) {
        System.out.println(psf);
      }

      return;
    }

    printStairPaths(n - 1, psf + 1);
    printStairPaths(n - 2, psf + 2);
    printStairPaths(n - 3, psf + 3);
  }
}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>
O(3^n)

The time complexity of the above solution is exponential. From each state, 3 recursive functions are called. So time complexity is O(3^n).

<i><b>SPACE COMPLEXITY :</b></i>
O(1)

And as no extra space is required, space complexity is constant. However, if we consider the space taken by the recursion call stack, then space complexity will be O(n) as the maximum depth of the recursion stack at any point can be equal to the length of the numeric string.

So reader, we hope that this article was helpful. We used a similar approach here that we used in "Print Subsequence". In case you still face any difficulties in the solution for the problem, you may visit the complete solution video. Don't lose hope whenever you get lost during understanding.
