<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach : </b></i>

<i><b>Input : </b></i>

You are required to enter the number of discs and the integer id's for all 3 towers.

What is our code expected to do?

You have to print instructions, in format n[n1 -> n2] which represents "move nth disc from tower n1 to tower n2". 

Following these instructions, all discs should get transferred from source tower to destination tower, such that no larger disc is placed over a smaller disc.

<i><b>Rules of game : </b></i>

You can move only 1 disc at a time.
A larger disc can never be placed under a smaller disc.
You can move only the top-most disc.
Let's start.

<i><b>Steps we should follow (High Level Thinking): </b></i>

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/tower_of_hanoi/tower_of_hanoi_2.png">

<i><b>Parameters of toh() : </b></i>

Number of discs to be transferred, source tower, destination tower and helper/auxiliary tower respectively.

<i><b>Base Case : </b></i>

We start with 3 discs. In recursive function calls, they keep on decreasing : 3, 2, 1, 0. But when there are 0 discs to transfer, there is no work left to do. Thus, we can simply return.

If(n==0) return;

```
import java.util.*;

public class Main
{
  public static void toh(int n, int t1, int t2, int t3)
  {
    if (n == 0)
      return;
    toh(n - 1, t1, t3, t2);
    System.out.println(n + "[" + t1 + " -> " + t2 + "]");
    toh(n - 1, t3, t2, t1);
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
  {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    int t1 = scn.nextInt();
    int t2 = scn.nextInt();
    int t3 = scn.nextInt();
    toh(n, t1, t2, t3);
  }
}
```

<i><b>Dry Run : </b></i>

Please watch the last question's solution video (print zigzag), if you haven't already.

In a function with 2 recursive calls, the first call is termed as the left call, and the second one is called the right call. These 2 calls divide the function into 3 parts :

For this particular question, we only have the In - region. So, the code looks like :

<i><b>Recursion tree </b></i>

We start with 3 discs and towers - A, B, C ?? toh(3, A, B, C)

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/tower_of_hanoi/tower_of_hanoi_7.png">

A series of left calls are made, i.e. 3ABC ?? 2ACB ?? 1ABC ?? 0ABC. 0ACB being the base case, the flow returns to 1ABC, for which the left call is executed, now it's time for IN-region execution. So we print 1[A -> B].

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/tower_of_hanoi/tower_of_hanoi_8.png">

Now, 1ABC makes the right call to 0CBA, which is again the base case, so the flow returns to 1ABC. 1ABC has executed fully, it gets wiped out from the stack and the flow comes back to 2ACB. Now, for 2ACB, the left call has been executed and now it's time for IN-region execution. So we print 2[A -> C].

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/tower_of_hanoi/tower_of_hanoi_9.png">

Now, 2ACB makes the right call to 1BCA. 1BCA makes a left call to 0BAC (Base Case), then executes the In-region by printing 1[B -> C].

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/tower_of_hanoi/tower_of_hanoi_10.png">

Lastly 1BCA makes the right call to 0ACB (Base Case). Now, 1BCA has executed fully, so it gets wiped out from the stack and the control falls back to 2ACB. Again, 2ACB has also executed completely, thus, it also gets wiped out from stack and the control comes down to 3ABC. Now, for 3ABC, the left call has been executed and now it's time for IN-region execution. So we print 3[A -> B].

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/tower_of_hanoi/tower_of_hanoi_11.png">

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/tower_of_hanoi/tower_of_hanoi_12.png">

Now, 3ABC makes the right call to 2CBA. 2CBA makes a left call to 1CAB, which in-turn makes a left call to 0CBA (Base Case). The control returns back to 1CAB, for which now, IN-region has to be executed by printing 1[C -> A].

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/tower_of_hanoi/tower_of_hanoi_13.png">

Now, 1CAB makes the right call to 0BAC (Base Case). The control comes back to 1CAB, which gets wiped out from stack as it has successfully executed. Now, the control comes down to 2CBA, for which the left call is completed. The IN-region gets executed for 2CBA by printing 2[C -> B].

<img src="tower_of_hanoi_14.png">
<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/tower_of_hanoi/tower_of_hanoi_14.png">

2CBA makes the right call to 1ABC, which in-turn makes the left call to 0ACB (Base case). The control comes back to 1ABC and since, left call has been executed, the IN-region is executed now by printing 1[A -> B].

1ABC makes a right call to 0CBA (Base Case). The control comes back to 1ABC, which returns the control to 2CBA, as it has executed successfully. 2CBA gets wiped out from the stack and returns control to 3ABC as it has executed successfully. Same is the case with 3ABC, it also gets wiped out from stack and returns control to main() (from where the function was initially called).

Now, if you follow the instructions you've printed all along, you'll see that all the discs have reached the destination tower, following all the rules.

Congratulations !! We did it.
I know, it might be difficult to absorb that this small piece of code did this whole task, but that's the beauty of recursion.

I hope that you found this problem as interesting as I did.

Hoping to meet you in the next module.

We hope that you understood the concept of Recursion successfully. In case you still face any difficulties in the solution for the problem, you may visit the complete solution [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDBrZFROuA0).

Happy Coding!
