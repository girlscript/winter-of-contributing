Do you know what Factorial of a number is?

The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number. For Example, Factorial of n=4 is 4*3*2*1.

You must know that the factorial of both 0 and 1 is 1. Factorials of negative integers do not exist.

We want you to meditate on the fact that 4! = 4 * 3! . Can you think why it is so ?

Let"s go through the High Level Thinking and Low Level Thinking of this problem:

We will go through all the 3 steps of High Level Thinking one at a time.

<i><b>Set Expectation : </b></i>

We expect that if we input n=5, then the output should be as shown in figure under the Expectation column.

<i><b>Build Faith : </b></i>

We must have faith that if our code can give us an output for n=5, then it can definitely give as an output for n=4. You just need to believe. Don"t focus on "HOW" that will happen.

<i><b>Expectation meets Faith : </b></i>For printing the desired output for n=5 , we could just print "5" before the output for n=4 (see figure).

This method uses the concept of PMI which we have already discussed in the previous article, "Print increasing Decreasing".

Now let"s start building the code .

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    int f = factorial(n);
    System.out.println(f);
  }

  public static int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 1) { //1
      return 1;
    }

    int fnm1 = factorial(n - 1); //2
    int fn = n * fnm1;  //3
    return fn;  //4
  }
}
```

<i style="text-decoration: underline"></b>Analysis </b></i>

If we don"t have a base condition that checks if the recursive function should be called or not then the program wouldn"t know when to stop.

Hence, we add a base condition to check when n reaches 1 then "1" is returned because factorial of 1=1.

Now let"s understand the Low Level Thinking by using the stacking process which has the following 2 parts:

When the stack moves up i.e. pushing in stack (Till n=1)
When the moves down i.e. popping of stack (After n=1)

<i><b>1. When stack moves up( or pushes in the stack) </b></i>

The pushing in the stack part of the program is depicted in 5 steps as follows:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/factorial/factorial_2.png">

The right side of the stack denotes the line numbers that have already been executed (refer to code).

Now let"s go through all the steps in detail:

Factorial function for n=5 is executed. //1 condition is checked. 

Since n!=1, we move on to //2 and a recursive call to n=4 is made.

Factorial function for n=4 is executed. 
//1 condition is checked. 

Since n!=1, we move on to //2 and a recursive call to n=3 is made.

Factorial function for n=3 is executed. //1 condition is checked. 

Since n!=1, we move on to //2 and a recursive call to n=2 is made.

Factorial function for n=2 is executed. //1 condition is checked. 

Since n!=1, we move on to //2 and a recursive call to n=1 is made.

Factorial function for n=1 is executed. //1 condition is checked. Since n==1, "1" is returned.

<i><b>2. When stack moves down( or pops off the stack) </b></i>

Now let"s go through all the steps of popping of a stack after n=1 in detail in the next 6 steps:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/factorial/factorial_3.png">

After 1 is returned , n=1 is popped off the stack.

The function returns to //3 of n=2.Hence fn receives n*fnm1= 2* 1=2 and returns 2 . //4 is called, n=2 is popped from the stack and the call reaches to n=3.

The function returns to //3 of n=3.Hence fn receives n*fnm1= 3* 2=6 . //4 is called, n=3 is popped from the stack and the call reaches to n=4.

The function returns to //3 of n=4.Hence fn receives n*fnm1= 4* 6=24 . //4 is called, n=4 is popped from the stack and the call reaches to n=5.

The function returns to //3 of n=5.Hence fn receives n*fnm1= 5* 24=120 . //4 is called, n=5 is popped from the stack and finally 120 is returned .

Now all the lines of the function have been called and the stack is empty, the command returns to the main function and 120 is returned.

We highly recommend you to watch the Youtube [video](https://youtu.be/m4rdYPuisKc) "Factorial of a number using recursion" if you still have any gaps in your understanding.

<i><b>Time Complexity : </b></i>
O(n)

This time complexity is linear because a recursion call is made.

<i><b>Space Complexity : </b></i>
O(1)

As no extra space is required, therefore space complexity is constant. However, if we include the space used in the recursive stack then the space complexity is O(n).

Happy coding!
