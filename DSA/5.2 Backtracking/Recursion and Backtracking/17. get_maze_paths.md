<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

We are given dimensions of a 2D maze as n and m which represent the rows and columns of the grid respectively.
We are standing at the top left ( i.e. [1,1] cell ) of this maze.

We have to reach the bottom right corner ( i.e. [n, m] cell ) of this maze.

We have to print all the paths to reach from the start point to the end point such that we move 1 step in the horizontal or vertical direction at a time.

For example, in a grid of 3*3 , following could be some of the paths :

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

As we have already discussed in the previous question "Get Stair Paths", if S denotes the source and D denotes the destination, and if there are

x ways to go from a to D

y ways to go from b to D

z ways to go from c to D

Then for going from S to D we will have x+y+z approaches.

Let's understand this figure for our previous example in Figure 1.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths/get_maze_paths_3.png">

Initially, with a step in the horizontal or vertical direction we can reach [1,2] cell and [2,1] cell respectively from the top left cell .

Then from there we calculate the paths required to move to the bottom right cell. Some examples of such paths are shown in figure 3.

We would like you to write the code of this problem yourself first, just to practice your recursion skills that you have developed in the previous recursion problems.

Now let's start building the code .

Look at the code given below. What do you think the output should be?

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    int m = scn.nextInt();
    ArrayList< String> paths = getMazePaths(1, 1, n, m);
    System.out.println(paths);
  }

  // sr - source row
  // sc - source column
  // dr - destination row
  // dc - destination column
  public static ArrayList< String> getMazePaths(int sr, int sc, int dr, int dc) {
    if (sr == dr && sc == dc) {                              //1
      ArrayList< String> bres = new ArrayList< >();
      bres.add("");
      return bres;
    }
    ArrayList< String> hpaths = new ArrayList< >();           //2.1
    ArrayList< String> vpaths = new ArrayList< >();           //2.2

    if (sc < dc) {
      hpaths = getMazePaths(sr, sc + 1, dr, dc);          //3.1
    }
    if (sr < dr) {
      vpaths = getMazePaths(sr + 1, sc, dr, dc);          //3.2
    }

    ArrayList< String> paths = new ArrayList< >();             //4

    for (String hpath : hpaths) {
      paths.add("h" + hpath);                              //5.1
    }

    for (String vpath : vpaths) {
      paths.add("v" + vpath);                              //5.2
    }
    return paths;                                            //6
  }

}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Code Discussion </b></i>

<i><b>Base Case: </b></i>

If the source row and column reach the destination row and column, then a new ArrayList bres is created. A blank path is added to it and the list is returned. 

Here we have 1 way to move because if we are already at the destination cell and have to move to the destination cell, we just keep on standing.

We create 2 ArrayLists "hpaths" and "vpaths" to store the list of paths that are in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively.

We check if we are still in the grid by checking whether the row and the column of the source are less than the row and column of the destination .

If the condition is true, we call the function getMazePaths recursively for source row+1 and column+1 which gives us all the paths from that position to the destination.

We declare a new ArrayList "paths" which stores all the final paths from the source cell to the destination cell.
To every path in hpaths, "h" is added.

Similarly, to every path in vpaths, "v" is added.

The ArrayList "paths" containing all the paths from source to destination are returned.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Recusrsive Tree </b></i>

You have already made a recursion tree in the pevious problems, refer them to build a tree for figure 1 on your own.

After making the tree, check your answer with ours.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths/get_maze_paths_4.png">

Here, the blue highlighted positions are achieved on moving a step in the horizontal direction and the green highlighted positions are achieved on moving a step in the vertical direction.

"h" and "v" written beside the edges denote the horizontal and vertical directions.

Here, we only consider those paths which reach till source=destination.

As we have already discussed, the paths which go beyond the destination are considered invalid .

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Euler Path </b></i>

Let's trace the Euler path for the tree in figure 4 and try to see the paths-so-far at different positions.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths/get_maze_paths_5.png">

Here, the Euler path is traced by green highlighter and you can see some of the valid paths written besides the vertex positions.

In figure 5, you can see that as we move up from source position level and reach the last level where source =destination, the path along the edges of all the levels is printed. The stack is filled at each level according to this Euler path.

Now that the path falls back on the previous level, the answer is printed and the last level is popped from the stack.

As the Euler path then moves up a level again, the new level gets pushed into the stack once again. 

This process of popping, pushing and printing keeps going on until all the paths have been printed.

When we reach the last answer on the tree, the path keeps moving down all the levels and the stack keeps popping until it is ultimately left empty.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis </b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity : </b></i>
O(2n)

This time complexity is exponential because for each state, 2 recursion calls are made.

<i><b>Space Complexity : </b></i>
O(1)

As no extra space is required, therefore space complexity is constant. However, if we include the space used in the recursive stack then the space complexity is O(n).
