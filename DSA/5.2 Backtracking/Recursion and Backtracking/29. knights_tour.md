<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

Given a number n which represents the size of a chess board, and a row and a column, as a starting point for a knight piece, you are required to generate the all moves of a knight starting in (row, col) such that knight visits all cells of the board exactly once.

A knight should move according to the rules in chess. Please explore the next moves in the clockwise direction to get the same result as ours.

One of the possible valid configuration for N = 8 can be:

Firstly spend an hour finding the logic and thinking of how to apply that. Then jump into the solution.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>(Naive) Solution:</b></i>

Naive solution will be to generate all possible permutations of numbers, and then check if every moving knight from cell with value v to cell with value v + 1 is possible or not.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

We are starting with the chess grid with all cells filled with 0 (empty cells). Now, we need to fill these cells so that the configuration becomes valid.

For every cell, we will try to place the knight (give the cell number with value = current move), and then call the recursive function for all the possible 8 moves as the next cell and move number greater by 1.

We should try to visualize how a knight moves on a chessboard.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/knights_tour/knights_tour_2.png">

If the current cell is (r, c), then we will try for all possible 8 moves (in clockwise direction), i.e. in the order (r-2, c+1), (r-1, c+2), (r+1, c+2), (r+2, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c-2), (r-1, c-2) and (r-2, c-1).

After making a move to one of the 8 possible, we will check if the current cell is valid or not, i.e. whether the value of the row or column has gone out of bound or not (< 0 or >= size of grid).

Also, the current move can be invalid if it had been already visited in any of the previous moves. This is because we are not allowed to visit any cell twice, i.e. we must visit every cell exactly once.

Hence, we will also return (invalid configuration), if the current cell is already filled with value > 0 (a move number).

Thus these are the checks to find whether the current cell is an invalid move or not:

row < 0 or row >= n (invalid row)
col < 0 or col >= n (invalid column)
chess[row][col] > 0 (already filled)
Now, the only condition left is the base case?

We will print the current configuration when we have already visited all the cells exactly once, i.e. the current move is equal to n2 where n = size of grid.

But before printing, we should fill the current cell with the last move (= n^2). And after printing, we will make the current cell back to 0 (empty), as we are backtracking (to print all possible configurations), and then return.

So what will be the code for this? Try to code on your own then match with the orginal code.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Pseudo Code</b></i>

If invalid move (row < 0, row >= n, col < 0, col >= n or chess[row][col] > 0), then return without printing.
If the base case is hit (got till the last move = n2), then fill the cell with move no, print the configuration, mark the cell empty back again (=0), and backtrack/return.
Before Recurring, mark the cell with the current move number.
Recur for all possible 8 moves with modified values of row and col, and a unit increment of the move number.
After returning from all 8 calls, mark the cell as empty again (=0) and return.

         i >= 0 && j >= 0; i--, j--) {
      if (chess[i][j] == 1) {
        return false;
      }
    }

    for (int i = row - 1, j = col; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (chess[i][j] == 1) {
        return false;
      }
    }

    for (int i = row - 1, j = col + 1; i >= 0
         && j < chess.length; i--, j++) {

      }
    }

    for (int i = row, j = col - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
      if (chess[i][j] == 1) {
        return false;
      }
    }

    return true;
  }

You can watch the whole logic and code of this problem in this [video](https://youtu.be/SP880DBRJ_8).

Suggestion is to draw a recursion tree and run your code line by line to better understand how backtracking works.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>

For each cell, we have 8 decisions to choose from for each of the n2 cell, the time complexity will be O(8(n^2)).

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>

The maximum number of recursive calls/depth of the recursion tree can be equal to the number of cells. Hence the recursion stack call will take atmax O(n2) space.

However, we are not using any extra data structure, hence the solution is said to have O(1) auxiliary space.

We hope that you understood the concept of Recursion successfully. In case you still face any difficulties in the solution for the problem, you may visit the complete solution [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP880DBRJ_8).

Happy Coding!
