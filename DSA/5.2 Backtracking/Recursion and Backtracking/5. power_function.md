<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

Given a number x, and another number n, you are required to calculate x raised to the power n i.e. x multiplied n times.

<i><b>Note: </b></i>If you have not tried enough to come up with logic, then we recommend you to first spend an hour or so doing it, else read only the logic used, take it as a hint and try the problem again with the same logic.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

For any recursive solution, you must define the expectation of the recursive function, then define a smaller sub-problem as the faith of the function, and finally derive a recursive relation using the <i><b>faith</b></i> and <i><b>expectation</b></i>.

<i><b>Expectation: </b></i>

You must first define the expectation of the recursive function power(x, n). It will give you the product of x multiplied n times i.e.

<i><b>Faith: </b></i>

Now, you should bring in faith in the recursive function (representing a smaller sub-problem) power(x, n-1) that on calling it, you will get the product of x multiplied n-1 times i.e.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/power_linear_&_logarithmic/power_linear_&_logarithmic_2.png">

<i><b>Recursive Relation: </b></i>

Now you need to meet the expectation with faith. Rearranging the first function we get,

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/power_linear_&_logarithmic/power_linear_&_logarithmic_3.png">

When you will compare powerx, n with powerx, n-1, then you will get the following recursive relation:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/power_linear_&_logarithmic/power_linear_&_logarithmic_4.png">

Are we done with the recursion, by defining a recursive relation? No, we are yet to define the base of the recursive function.

<i><b>Base Case: </b></i>

Now, you should think about what can be the base case.

Mathematically, if n = 0, then irrespective of the value of x, the value of x0 will be 1. Hence you can return 1 as soon as n becomes 0.

<i><b>Important Note: </b></i>If the base case is not handled, then the above recursive call will keep on calling for negative values of n, and the recursion call stack will overflow giving a run-time error.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Pseudo Code for power (x, n) Function </b></i>

If n is 0, then return 1.
Else
Get the value of powerx, n-1
Return that value multiplied by x
Note: Before reading the Code, we recommend that you must try to come up with the solution on your own.

Now, hoping that you have tried by yourself, here is the Java code.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    int x = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
    int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
    int p = power(x, n);
    System.out.println(p);
  }

  public static int power(int x, int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
      return 1;
    }
    int xpnm1 = power(x, n - 1);
    int xpn = xpnm1 * x;
    return xpn;
  }

}
```

If you are confused how the above recursive function works, then you should draw a recursion call stack and see how recursive calls are made.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>
O(n)

Since you are recursively calling for a subproblem with n-1 from n, hence n + 1 recursive calls will be made (+ 1 when it hits the base case n = 0). You can also count the number of recursive calls in the call stack. So the time complexity turns out to be O(n) (which is independent of the value of x).

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>
O(1)

There is no data structure used, thus no auxiliary space is used. Hence, space complexity is O(1).

<i><b>Note: </b></i>There are n recursive calls that do take stack space, but we do not account for this space as we are only concerned with space used by data structures defined by us.

However, if it is mentioned to give the space complexity which takes into account the space taken by recursion call stack also, then, since there are n recursive calls, hence O(n) space will be required.

<i><b>Follow Up :</b></i>

Don"t you feel that O(n) time for calculating just x^n is way too expensive?

Can you improve the time complexity of the above problem?
Can you derive a better recursive relation?

<i><b>Hint: </b></i>Try to think about the divide and conquer strategy. Try to divide the problem into fewer subproblems.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Power - Logarithmic
Approach :</b></i>

<i><b>Question Link : </b></i>[Click](https://www.pepcoding.com/resources/online-java-foundation/introduction-to-recursion/power-logarithmic-official/ojquestion).

Before reading the algorithm used, please try this problem on your own using the hint provided.

Now, since you may have tried enough, here is the better solution to the problem stated above.

<i><b>Expectation: </b></i>Your expectation with the function powerx, n should remain the same i.e.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/power_linear_&_logarithmic/power_linear_&_logarithmic_6.png">

<i><b>Faith: </b></i>You need to think of a more reduced sub-problem which you will have faith on. Can you break xn in terms of xn/2 instead of xn-1.

Are you able to think of the formula mentioned below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/power_linear_&_logarithmic/power_linear_&_logarithmic_7.png">

But is this formula valid for all positive values of n? 

What about odd positive integers?

Though the above formula holds good for positive even integral values of n, in the case of odd positive integers, your formula should look like

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/power_linear_&_logarithmic/power_linear_&_logarithmic_8.png">

{ where n/2 is the floor value of the resultant (since n = odd number) }

So you can have faith in a recursive function power(x,n/2) , that it will give you the value of x when multiplied n/2 times i.e.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/power_linear_&_logarithmic/power_linear_&_logarithmic_9.png">

<i><b>Recursive Relation: </b></i>Now, you need to meet the expectation with your faith. If n is odd { n/2 is the floor value when n is divided by 2}

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/power_linear_&_logarithmic/power_linear_&_logarithmic_10.png">

Else n is even

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/power_linear_&_logarithmic/power_linear_&_logarithmic_11.png">

<i><b>Base Case: </b></i>As in the previous case, the base case will remain the same i.e. x0=1 irrespective of the value of x. Hence, the base case will be when n becomes 0.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Pseudo Code for power (x, n) Function</b></i>

If n is 0, then return 1.

Else

Get the value of power(x,n/2) in a variable named "xpnb2"
If n is odd, then return x*xpnb2*xpnb2

Else (n is even), return xpnb2*xpnb2

<i><b>Note: </b></i>Before reading the Code, we recommend that you must try to come up with the solution on your own. Now, hoping that you have tried by yourself, here is the Java code.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    BufferedReader br = new
    BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    int x = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
    int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
    int p = power(x, n);
    System.out.println(p);
  }

  public static int power(int x, int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
      return 1;
    }
    int xpnb2 = power(x, n / 2);
    // n/2 will automatically get floor value
    // since it is type casted to int.

    int xpn = xpnb2 * xpnb2;

    if (n % 2 == 1) {
      xpn = xpn * x;
    }

    return xpn;
  }

}
```
If you doubt how the above recursive function works, then you should draw a recursion call stack and see how recursive calls are made.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/power_linear_&_logarithmic/power_linear_&_logarithmic_12.png">

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis </b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>
O(log2 n)

Since you are recursively calling for a subproblem with n/2 from n, hence at max log2 (n) recursive calls will be made. 

You can also count the number of recursive calls in the call stack. So the time complexity turns out to be log2 (n) (which is independent of the value of x).

Are you wondering how reducing n to n/2 brings down the number of recursive calls from O(n) to O(log n)? 

Can you think of a mathematical proof?

<i><b>Hint: </b></i>Try finding the pattern in the values of n in recursive calls and find the count of recursive calls using this sequence.

<i><b>Proof of Logarithmic Time Complexity:</b></i>

When you will draw the recursion call stack, you will see that the value of n reduces by a factor of 2 always, i.e. it reduces in the following sequence:

n,n/2, n/4,n/8, n/16, .... upto 1. (Leaving the base case for better understanding).

Can you see that the above pattern forms a geometric progression (G.P.) ?

Indeed, it is a geometric progression with the first term a = 1 and the constant ratio r = 1/2.

Let the number of recursive calls be k (which is in turn equal to the number of terms in G.P.)

Then, you can apply the formula of the kth term of G.P. which will be:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/power_linear_&_logarithmic/power_linear_&_logarithmic_13.png">

On solving the above equation we get, n=2k-1, then taking log2 on both sides of the equation we get k=1+n , i.e. k is O(log2 n).

Since k is the number of recursive calls, hence the time complexity of the above solution is proved to be O(log2 n).

What is the difference in this <i><b>logarithmic solution</b></i> when compared to the <i><b>linear complexity solution</b></i>?

In the previous (linear complexity) solution, there were at max O(n) recursive calls made, hence O(n) time complexity, but here only at max O(log n) recursive calls are made, hence time complexity reduces to O(log n) only which is way less than O(n).

Calculate log2 n for n = 10, 100, 1000, 104, 105, etc. You will get to know that there is a significant difference between O(log2 n) and O(n).

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/power_linear_&_logarithmic/power_linear_&_logarithmic_14.png">

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>
O(1)

There is no data structure used, thus no auxiliary space is used. Hence, space complexity is O(1).

If the recursion call stack is taken into account, then space complexity will be O(log2 n) as there are k = (log2 n) recursive calls.

<i><b>Note: </b></i>Please remember that the above solution does not guarantee the right solution for large values of xn as such values cannot be stored in the int data type. 

Hence, trying the above solution might give unexpected results in such cases. Can you guess what we should do in this case?

There will be many methods which can help us solve for large values of n, and one of them can be to take modulo arithmetic.

We hope that you understood the concept of Recursion successfully.
