<i style="text-decofration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

Now that you have gone through "Get Subsequence", let's discuss why there is even a need for a second approach?

Well, the answer is simple, it wasn"t an optimized solution. Let's discuss HOW.

We calculate the memory required to store the Array List for the string "abc".

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_subsequence/print_subsequence_1.png">

Let's look below at the calculation of memory required to store an ArrayList for a string of length n .

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_subsequence/print_subsequence_2.png">

For "abc" , the length of the string is 3 , and has 23 subsequences stored in its ArrayList.

As denoted by the arrows, there are 23/2 pairs (i.e. half of the total subsequences) or 22 = 4 pairs of subsequences.

Notice that the size of each pair is 3 (each pair has a sum of 3 characters), hence, the total number of characters for 22 pairs is 22 x 3 =12 characters.

Using this example, we obtain a formula. For a string of length n , the ArrayList obtained will have 2n-1 * n characters.

Therefore, for a string of 31 length , we apply the above formula and simplify it, we obtain that 31 * 109 characters are stored in the ArrayList which give us the memory estimate of about 31-freaking- GB !

We don't have enough RAM for it! Do you now realize that this is not an optimal solution ?

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

Now, back to "Print Subsequences" , if you have read the problem statement carefully, we just have to print all the subsequences .

We don't have to store all of them at one place. So we can simply find one subsequence and print it, then another and so on. Let's see how.

<i><b>Recursion Tree </b></i>

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_subsequence/print_subsequence_3.png">

We discuss this figure piece by piece.

At level 1, we take the unsolved question "abc" which is written as the numerator and the answer part is written as the denominator. 

Since we don't have an answer to this problem yet we leave the denominator as a blank.'

We divide the question "abc" into 2 parts: the first character "a" and the remaining substring "bc". 

Here, we have 2 options whether to have "a" in the answer or not when the question is "bc".

At level 2, we again break the question, "bc" into "b" and "c". We decide whether or not to add "b" into the answer part or not.

Now we reach Level 3, here "c" is to be divided. So the first character, "c" has two options, whether to be added in the previous answer or not and the question part doesn"t exist anymore i.e. it"s a blank . 

So we don't show the question at the last level.

The answers at the last level are decided on whether "c" is added to the previous answer or not. 

Doing that, we obtain all possible answers ( or subsequences) to our original question "abc".

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_subsequence/print_subsequence_4.png">

Figure 4 describes the number of elements at each level and how they double at every level.

Reader, all the answers at the last level of the tree are representative of all the options we chose along a path.

To know whether or not you have understood the Recursion tree try to draw it yourself for different strings. 

If there are still some gaps in your understanding, don't worry. This concept takes time to settle in the mind. Just keep practicing it.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Euler Path</b></i>

Now that we have made a recursive tree, let's understand how we travel through it and by and by print each subsequence.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_subsequence/print_subsequence_5.png">

In figure 5, you can see that we move from "abc" i.e level 1 to level 2 to level 3 and at the end reach the last level where the question is empty so the answer is printed. 

The stack is filled at each level according to this euler path as you can see in Figure 6.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_subsequence/print_subsequence_6.png">

Now that the path falls back on the previous level, the answer is printed and the last level is popped from the stack.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_subsequence/print_subsequence_7.png">

As the euler path then moves up a level again, the new level gets pushed into the stack once again. 

This process of popping, pushing and printing keeps going on until all the subsequent answers have been printed.

When the path reaches the last subsequence which is a blank , it keeps moving down all the levels and the stack keeps popping until it is ultimately left empty.

For printing each subsequence ,the stack uses a memory of (n+1). 

Hence, for printing all the subsequences, the memory is n*(n+1) which is very less than (2n-1 * n) taken to get all the subsequences using an ArrayList.

Now that we understand how the recursion tree is made and how the path works, we try to write the code for it.

Can you write it on your own?

If you are not able to, then just refer to the following code. With time, you will be able to write it confidently yourself.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    String str = scn.next();
    printSS(str, "");                                            //1
  }

  public static void printSS(String ques, String ans) {
    if (ques.length() == 0) {                                  //2
      System.out.println(ans);
      return;
    }

    char ch = ques.charAt(0);                                   //3
    String roq = ques.substring(1);                             //4
    printSS(bc, ans + ch);                                      //5
    printSS(bc, ans + "");                                      //6
  }
}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>CODE DISCUSSION</b></i>

The input string is passed as the question and since this question is unanswered, a blank string is passed as the answer.

<i><b>Base Case: </b></i>

If the ques length reaches 0, then we print the answer and return the function.

We separate the first element i.e. "a" of the ques string and store it in char ch.

Next we store the remaining part of the ques string i.e "bc" in the string roq.

The function printSS is recursively called on roq i.e. bc ,which will provide us all the subsequences with the first character ch added to each of the answers.

The function printSS is recursively called on roq i.e. bc ,which will provide us all the subsequences with the first character ch not added to any of the answers. We depict this by adding a blank string to the answers.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis </b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>
O(2n)

This time complexity is exponential because for each state, 2 recursion calls are made.

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>
O(1)

As no extra space is required, therefore space complexity is constant. However, if we include the space used in the recursive stack then the space complexity is O(n).
