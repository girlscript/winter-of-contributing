<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion : </b></i>

You are given a number n, representing the count of elements of an array, and then you are given n numbers representing elements of array.

After that you are given a number x. We are required to find the last index at which x occurs in an array of length n.

If x exists in an array, then we need to print the last index where it is found, otherwise we print -1.

For example:

<i><b>Input:</b></i> 
```
(6 5 7 4 2 1 4 1)
n=6
arr[] = {5, 7, 4, 2, 1, 4}
x = 1
```
<i><b>Output:</b></i> 
```
5
```
<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Explanation:</b></i>

There are two occurrences of 4 at index 2 and 5. But the last occurrence is at index 5.

<i><b>Note -</b></i> The online judge can"t force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is. Write recursive and not iterative logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

Let"s try to define our Expectation and Faith for the recursive function lastIndex(arr, 0, x)

Our expectation is that the function lastIndex(arr, 0, x), will run and check the last occurrence of x.

And our faith is that the function lastIndex(arr, 1, x), works perfectly and therefore will return us the last occurrence of x in case there is a value equal to x otherwise it will return -1.

Your work is to link expectation with faith. We have faith that the function lastIndex(arr, 1, x) will return us either the last occurrence or -1. 

But we want the result for lastIndex(arr, 0, x) and if lastIndex(arr, 1, x) returns -1, then we surely need to do some self work.

If lastIndex(arr, 1, x) returns -1, this implies there was no element equal to x in arr.

So now we need to check the element at the first index.
If the value at the first index is equal to x then return 0 (i.e. index) else -1.

Let"s, try to code this:

```
public static int lastIndex(int[] arr, int idx, int x) {
  if (idx == arr.length) {
    return -1;

  }

  int liisa = lastIndex(arr, idx + 1, x);
  if (liisa == -1) {
    if (arr[idx] == x) {
      return idx;
    } else {
      return -1;
    }
    else {
      return liisa;
    }
  }
```

As we have seen in various previous questions, we need to stop the further execution of this type of recursive function when our idx becomes equal to array length.

Let"s dry run this code for an input of: (10 2 3 6 9 8 3 2 3 6 4 3) i.e.

n = 10
arr[] = {2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 3, 2, 3, 6, 4}
x = 3

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/last_index/last_index_1.png">

Function lastIndex(arr, 0, 3), gets called from the main and is pushed in the stack.

Statement-1 of this function gets executed and lastIndex(arr, 1, 3) gets a call and is also pushed in the stack.

Same way all the function for increasing the value of index gets pushed in the stack until the base case is hit inside lastIndex(arr, 10, 3) and -1 is returned.

After that control returns back to the lastIndex(arr, 9, 3), Statement-2 gets executed, which is true. 

Then Statement-2.1 executes and the "if" condition is checked (arr[9]==3) which is false. So control jumps to else Statement-2.3 which returns -1 to the lastIndex(arr, 8, 3).

Similarly, control now returns back to the lastIndex(arr, 8, 3), Statement-2 gets executed, which is true. 

Then Statement-2.1 executes and the "if" condition is checked (arr[8]==3) which is false. So control jumps to else Statement-2.3 which returns -1 to the lastIndex(arr, 7, 3) .

Control now returns to the lastIndex(arr, 7, 3), Statement-2 gets executed, which is true. 

Then Statement-2.1 executes and the "if" condition is checked (arr[7]==3) which is true. So Statement-2.3 gets executed returning 7(index) to the lastIndex(arr, 6, 3).

After that control returns back to the lastIndex(arr, 6, 3), Statement-2 gets executed. And the "if" condition is checked which is false. 

So control jumps to else Statement-2.3 which returns the same value returned by lastIndex(arr, 7, 3), which is stored in int liisa (last index in smaller array).

This value,7, keeps returning back to the previous stack because each time Statement-2 executes, which is false, control comes to Statement-3, which simply returns liisa (last index in smaller array).

7 is finally returned to main as our final result.
You can watch this part of the solution video for better understanding of dry run.

I hope that you are able to understand the problem. I advise you to take a sheet of paper and a pen and dry run your code for input:Input: (6 5 7 4 2 1 4 1):- n=6, arr[] = {5, 7, 4, 2, 1, 4}, x = 1

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    int[] arr = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      arr[i] = scn.nextInt();
    }
    int x = scn.nextInt();
    ` int li = lastIndex(arr, 0, x);
    `System.out.println(li);
  }

  public static int lastIndex(int[] arr, int idx, int x) {
    if (idx == arr.length) {
      return -1;
    }

    int liisa = lastIndex(arr, idx + 1, x);
    if (liisa == -1) {
      if (arr[idx] == x) {
        return idx;
      } else {
        return -1;
      }
      else {
        return liisa;
      }
    }
  }
```
<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis </b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>
O(n)

As n (array"s length) calls are made and work is done corresponding to these n calls therefore the time complexity becomes O(n).

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>
O(1)

Since no extra space is used, therefore space complexity is constant, however you should know that if the recursion call stack is taken into account, then space complexity will be O(n) as there are n recursive calls.

So reader, we hope that this article was helpful in understanding the depth of Recursion. In case you still face any difficulties in the solution for the problem, you may visit the complete solution [video](https://youtu.be/xttMLI4Kb3k).
Keep practicing more questions on recursion!
