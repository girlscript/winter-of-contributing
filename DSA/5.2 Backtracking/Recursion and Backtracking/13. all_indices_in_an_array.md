<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Understanding problem:</b></i>

You are given an array and a number x. We are required to return an array with all the indices at which x occurs in an array.

For example:

<i><b>Input: </b></i>
```
arr = {5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 7}, X = 3
```
<i><b>Output: </b></i>
```
{1, 3}
```
Element 3 is present at indices 1 and 3..

<i><b>Note - </b></i>the online judge can't force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is. Write recursive and not iterative logic. 

The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.

You may check out the question video, for better understanding of what needs to be done.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity: </b></i>
O(n), where n is the length of the array.

<i><b>Space Complexity: </b></i>
O(n)

So, for this problem, we don't need to take any input. A function is already defined as: public static int[] allIndices(int[] arr, int x, int idx, int fsf).

We just need to complete this code.

Looking at this public static int[] allIndices(int[] arr, int x, int idx, int fsf), we can see that as a parameter, there is an array arr, a number x, an index and an integer fsf is passed. 

Integer fsf (found so far) will keep a track of how many times we have visited x. Array and x are the values that the user provides.

Here our main problem is to know the size of the array in which we will store all indices of x. That's when the integer fsf (found so far) comes into use.
We will use the concept that when we go up in the stack using recursion, we come back also. So, while going up on the stack we will keep updating fsf and as soon as base case hits, we define an array of size fsf, and while returning i.e. while moving down on stack, we will fill that array with all indices of x.

Let's try to code this.

Ok, as we already coded, let's now dry run this for better understanding.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/all_indices_in_an_array/all_indices_in_an_array_3.png">

We first run statement 1 for idx =0, which is false then we jump to statement 2. Statement 2 makes a for varied idx = 1.
Function for idx = 1 is pushed in stack and statement 1 of this executes, which is true, now statement 1.1 runs and next call for idx = 2 and incremented fsf is made.
Similarly, we keep moving up on the stack with updated fsf and incremented index.
It finally stops when, index becomes equal to array length. It is now, when an array is defined of fsf length.
Now, we move down the stack and fill our iarr array.
At index =10, 9 and 8, statement 3 runs and iarr is returned as it is.
At index = 7, statement 1.2 runs and iarr is updated.
At index = 6, statement 3 runs and iarr is returned as it is.
At index = 5, statement 1.2 runs and iarr is updated.
At index = 4, 3 and 2, statement 3 runs and iarr is returned as it is.
At index = 1, statement 1.2 runs and iarr is updated.
At index = 0, statement 3 runs and iarr is updated.

Make sure the logic is clear for this problem. If not till now then watch the video above one or more time.

<i style="text-decoration:underline">Analysis:</i><br>
<i style="text-decoration:underline">Time Complexity:</i><br>
As n (array's length) calls are made and work is done corresponding to these n calls therefore the time complexity becomes O(n).

<i style="text-decoration:underline">Space Complexity:</i><br>
Since an array has been used to store all the indices which can be, therefore space complexity is constant, however you should know that if the recursion call stack is taken into account, then space complexity will be O(n) as there are n recursive calls.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n =

    int[] arr = new int[n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      arr[i] = scn.nextInt();
    }
    int x = scn.nextInt();
    int[] iarr = allIndices(arr, x, 0, 0);

    if (iarr.length == 0) {
      System.out.println();
      return;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < iarr.length; i++) {
      System.out.println(iarr[i]);
    }
  }

  public static int[] allIndices(int[] arr, int x, int idx, int fsf) {
    if (idx == arr.length) {
      return new int[fsf];
    }

    int[] iarr;

    if (arr[idx] == x) {
      iarr = allIndices(arr, x, idx + 1, fsf + 1);
      iarr[fsf] = idx;
    } else {
      iarr = allIndices(arr, x, idx + 1, fsf);
    }

    return iarr;
  }

}

I hope this question is clear to you, practice more such questions for better understanding.<br>
Thank you.
