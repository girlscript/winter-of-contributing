<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

Firstly read the question and understand that on your own.

i) You are given a number n, representing the size of array a.

ii) You are given n numbers, representing elements of array a.

iii) You are required to print the elements of array from end to beginning each in a separate line.

iv) For the above purpose complete the body of displayArrReverse function. Don't change the signature.
  
<i><b>Input Format: </b></i>
```
A number n
n1
n2
.. n number of elements
```
<i><b>Output Format: </b></i>
```
n1
n2
.. n elements
```

I hope you made some logic in your mind.

So, we will solve this problem using the traditional approach. First define our Expectation, Faith, and then derive our Expectation using our Faith. First, you should give it a try.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

We have a recursive formula displayArrRev(arr, idx).

Check if idx is a valid index. If not simply return. This is our base case.

Make a recursive call with parameters arr and idx+1
Print the value at the index idx i.e arr[idx].

<i><b>Expectation:</b></i>

Let's say we have the array arr[] and we define our expectation that displayArrRev(arr, 0) will display all the elements in the array arr[] in reverse i.e from the last index to index 0. 

Let's understand by an example.

Now, let's define our Faith

<i><b>Faith:</b></i>

Say this line with me. "I have faith that displayArrRev(arr, 1) will display the contents of the array in reverse from the last index till index 1". 

Just don"t say, completely internalize this line/faith. 

Let's look at the illustration below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/display_array_in_reverse/display_array_in_reverse_2.png">

Now the question arises, Can we somehow meet our "expectation" from the "faith" that we have established? Let's do that.

<i><b>Expectation from Faith:</b></i>

So, our expectation says displayArrRev(arr, 0) will display all the contents in reverse from index n-1 till index 0. And we have faith that displayArrRev(arr, 1) will display all the contents from n-1 till index 1 in reverse.

In the expectation, we can first call the displayArrRev for 1 and then simply print the current element.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/display_array_in_reverse/display_array_in_reverse_3.png">

Basically, we calling our Faith i.e displayArrRev(arr, 1) to print the other numbers in reverse and then simply print the 10. Thus finally we will see that displayArrRev(arr, 0) will display all the elements in reverse from index n-1 to index 0.

So, just the <i><b>pseudocode</b></i> for this part:

```
function displayArrRev(arr, idx):
displayArrRev(arr, idx+1)
print arr[idx]
```

But we are missing something. Can you tell what we are missing? Yes, a base case. Clearly here the base case will be that idx should not be greater than the size of the array.

```
function displayArrRev(arr, idx):
if idx == arr.length()
return
displayArrRev(arr, idx+1)
print arr[idx]
```

Here is the recursion tree:

How can just changing the order of the print line make it reverse?

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/display_array_in_reverse/display_array_in_reverse_6.png">

Initially, in the previous problem, we were printing in the pre-area i.e before the recursive call. As a result, before the recursive function call was put into the runtime stack the data was printed. 20 was printed before 30,40,50.

But in this case, what we did was bring the print down to the post-area i.e after the recursion call. Hence the data is printed when the function call is about to be popped from the runtime stack, not when it was just pushed into the stack. And hence the output is in reversed fashion.

If you are still confused. Do one thing. Imagine a stack (which is LIFO i.e Last In First Out). Insert 10, 20, 30 and when you pop you will first get 30. then again on popping, we will get 20, then finally popping we will get 10. We inserted 10,20,30 but while popping the data we are getting are in the order 30, 20, 10 i,e reversed order.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);

    int n = scn.nextInt();
    int[] arr = new int[n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      arr[i] = scn.nextInt();
    }

    displayArrRev(arr, 0);

  }

  public static void displayArrRev(int[] arr, int idx) {
    if (idx == arr.length) return;
    displayArrRev(arr, idx + 1);
    System.out.println(arr[idx]);
  }

}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>
O(n)

Let's try to understand our time complexity. It will be similar to the previous problem. Since we are making at most n recursion calls and in each call we are performing O(1) operations (printing a data is constant time) so our overall time complexity is n*O(1) = O(n).

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>
O(n)

Also, we know for each recursion call the parameters, address of the array are stored in the runtime stack, and since the recursive call stack is of n length it will also take n space in the stack. Although we are not using any array the space complexity will still be O(n).
