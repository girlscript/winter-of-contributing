<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion : </b></i>

So, our problem is to print the maze paths with jumps. To understand the question, look at the figure given below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_1.png">

We will be given an nxm matrix as in (fig-1) we are given a 5x4 matrix. 

We are initially at starting position M[1][1]. We have to reach the final position i.e. M[5][4]. For doing that we can take three types of steps

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Vertical Steps: </b></i>

We can move down in the column by any number of steps that we want to. 

For instance, from M[1][1] we may move just a single step to M[2][1] or we may move 2 steps and go directly to M[3][1] or in fact, we may directly move from M[1][1] to M[5][1].

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Horizontal Steps: </b></i>

We can move in the forward direction within the same row and we may move by as many steps as we want. 

For instance, from M[1][1] we may move one step to M[1][2] or two steps to M[1][3] or we may directly jump from M[1][1] to M[1][4].

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Diagonal Steps: </b></i>

We can also move along the diagonal and we may take as many steps as we want to. 

For instance, from M[1][1], we may move to M[2][2] or M[3][3] or even directly to M[4][4].

So, hope you got the question.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach : </b></i>

So friend, hope you tried the problem by yourself. 

How did that go? 

You already know how we are approaching these kinds of source-destination problems till now. 

Let's start our discussion and explore this problem in depth.

<i><b>High-Level Thinking: </b></i>

First of all, let us try to decide what exactly we are going to do. Have a look at the diagram shown below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_2.png">

We are given this matrix and we have to reach the destination. 

We have understood the question and we know that we can move any number of valid steps in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions. Have a look at (fig-3) shown below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_3.png">

We start from M[1][1] and we can reach many spots from M[1][1]. Some of them are shown in the diagram. 

But as you have solved the previous problems, you know that we need to find all the spots that can be reached from our initial spot so that we can call our function recursively on each of those spots and print all the paths. 

So, let's try to do that first. 

Let's try to find out all the possible spots.

<i><b>Finding all Initial Spots Along the Row: </b></i>

Look at the diagram given below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_4.png">

The diagram above shows all the possible destinations that we can reach directly from M[1][1] along the row. 

So in general, for any matrix of size nxm we can have these initial spots along the row:

M[1][1], M[1][2], M[1][3],.....M[1][c].

<i><b>Maximum Number Of Moves Along a Row: </b></i>

If we think in terms of the number of moves that we can make in this direction, you can see that the maximum possible move is of size 5.

Now, this is not just for the initial row rather it is for every row. 

Assume we took 1 vertical step first. 

So now we are at M[2][1], so what are the maximum possible moves in the direction of this row? (It will be the same as that for the initial row and it will be the same for every row).

To move along a row, we are changing the columns while remaining in the same row. 

Now, the starting point of any row is actually sc i.e. the source column=1 and the endpoint of a row is the last column or the dc i.e. destination column (which is=6 in the above diagram).

So, the maximum possible moves that we can make and also the max possible size of move/jump that we can make along a row is (dc-sc) which is 6-1=5.

Finding all initial spots along the column:
Look at the diagram given below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_6.png">

We are at M[1][1] at the beginning of our problem. We can either move to M[2][1] by 1 step or we may directly move 2,3 or even 4 steps forward. 

So, the initial spots along the column are:

M[1][1], M[2][1], M[3][1] and M[4][1].

In general, for a matrix with n number of rows:
M[1][1], M[2][1],......M[n][1].

<i><b>Maximum Number Of moves along a Column: </b></i>

If we think in terms of the number of moves that we can make in this direction, you can see that the maximum possible move is of size 4. 

Now, this is not just for the initial column rather it is for every column. 

Assume we took 1 horizontal step first. 

So now we are at M[1][2], so what are the maximum possible moves in the direction of this column? (It will be the same as that for the initial column and it will be the same for every column).

To move along a column, we are changing the rows while remaining in the same column. 

Now, the starting point of any column is actually sr i.e. the source row=1, and the endpoint of a column is the last row or the dr i.e. destination row(which is=5 in the above diagram).

So, the maximum possible moves that we can make and also the max possible size of move/jump that we can make along a column is (dr-sr) which is 5-1=4.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_7.png">

<i><b>Finding all Initial spots along the diagonal: </b></i>

Have a look at the diagram shown below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_8.png">

We start from M[1][1] and we can either go to M[2][2] by taking 1 jump or we may go to M[3][3] by taking a jump of size=2. 

So the initial spots along the diagonal are:

M[1][1], M[2][2], M[3][3] and M[4][4].

In general, if a matrix is of order nxm where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns then:

If n>m:
Initial Spots: M[1][1]...M[m][m]

Else if m>=n:
Initial spots: M[1][1]....M[n][n]

Also, the max size of a jump will depend on the same factor.

If rows n>m then the max possible size of jumps will be the same as the size of jump of m else it will be the same as the size of jump of n.

<i><b>Expectation: </b></i>

We want to print all possible paths from source to destination in a maze.

<i><b>Faith: </b></i>

Recursion will give us the paths from a spot that is directly reachable from the source.

<i><b>Relation: </b></i>

We will get the paths from an initial spot to the destination spot using recursion. Before printing it will add to it, the path we took to reach that initial point.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Low-Level Thinking: </b></i>

We have already made a lot of efforts in this question till now. We have done a lot of work in the high-level thinking procedure. 

Now, it is time to think about the base case. Look at the matrix given below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_9.png">

This is a 2x3 matrix. If we dry run the above code for this matrix we will get a Euler tree as follows:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_10.png">

We started from M[1][1]. Then, we entered the loop of horizontal rows and a recursive call starts for tracing the path (refer to the code side by side). 

From M[1][1] we move to M[1][2] on a recursive call. We have moved "h1" i.e. one horizontal step and the recursive call is again made in the horizontal direction and we move to M[1][3].

Now after M[1][3] we do not have any element in that row. So, a recursive call for horizontal direction can not be made. So, the vertical call was made and for that, we went to M[2][3] which is the destination. 

<i><b>Note: </b></i>

We have not shown any invalid calls in the Euler tree like the horizontal call and the diagonal call made for M[2][3]. 

So, we can very clearly understand that the base case for this recursion is when we reach our destination i.e. when row=dr (destination row) and column=dc (destination column).

We request you to trace the Euler path and draw the Euler tree yourself to understand the concept in-depth.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_11.png">

Now that we know the base case also, let's try to write the complete code:

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    int m = scn.nextInt();

    ArrayList< String> paths = getMazePaths(1, 1, n, m);

    System.out.println(paths);
  }

  // sr - source row
  // sc - source column
  // dr - destination row
  // dc - destination column
  public static ArrayList< String> getMazePaths(int sr, int sc, int dr, int dc) {

    if (sr == dr && sc == dc)
    {
      ArrayList< String> bres = new ArrayList< >();
      bres.add("");
      return bres;
    }
    else if (sr > dr || sc > dc)
    {
      ArrayList< String> bres = new ArrayList< >();
      return bres;
    }

    ArrayList< String> paths = new ArrayList< >();
    for (int hms = 1; hms <= dc - sc; hms++)
    {
      ArrayList< String> hpaths = getMazePaths(sr, sc + hms, dr, dc);

      for (String hpath : hpaths)
      {
        paths.add("h" + hms + hpath);
      }
    }

    for (int vms = 1; vms <= dr - sr; vms++)
    {
      ArrayList< String> vpaths = getMazePaths(sr + vms, sc, dr, dc);

      for (String vpath : vpaths) {
        paths.add("v" + vms + vpath);
      }
    }

    for (int dms = 1; dms <= dr - sr && dms <= dc - sc; dms++)
    {
      ArrayList< String> dpaths = getMazePaths(sr + dms, sc + dms, dr, dc);

      for (String dpath : dpaths)    {
        paths.add("d" + dms + dpath);
      }
    }
    return paths;
  }
}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis </b></i>

Well, this is going to be fun. Try and understand every step from here as it is going to be a little bit tilted to mathematics.

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>

The time complexity of the algorithm will depend on 3 recursive calls, one which is made for rows, the second which is made for the columns, and the other which is made for the diagonals.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_12.png">

Since while moving in the row, the column is changed and the number of columns keep on decreasing while we move forward in a row the T.C of row is denoted by T(n,m-1). 

Similarly, when we move in a column the number of rows decreases therefore it is denoted by T(n-1,m). Also, when we move in a diagonal, the rows and columns both decrease. Therefore it"s time complexity is denoted by T(n-1,m-1).

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_13.png">

The fastest way to travel in the matrix is to take the longest jump in the diagonal and the slowest way to move or the worst-case scenario will be to move by only one step in a row and then move by only one step in the col.

The average case time complexity will be equal to the worst-case time complexity. 

So, let's try to find out the worst-case complexity of this question. For that, we assume that the number of rows is greater than the number of columns (you can assume the opposite also).

<Img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_14.png">

Since we have assumed that the number of rows is the largest and traversal in columns depends upon the number of rows so they will be responsible for the overall time complexity the maximum. 

So, if we replace the other functions with the time complexity function of column recursive call, the equal sign changes as column complexity is the largest so its thrice will always be greater than or equal to the overall complexity.

Now, the calculations go as follows:


<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_15.png">

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_16.png">

This means that we have completed all the rows (since n=0). In other words, we have moved along one column. Now, we will move along the row. So, now the time complexity will depend upon T(n,m-1).

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_17.png">

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_18.png">

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_19.png">

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_maze_paths_with_jumps/get_maze_paths_with_jumps_20.png">

Therefore the time complexity is: O(3n+m)

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>

The space complexity cannot be defined when space is increasing continuously (as the Arraylist size keeps on increasing with new paths being added). 

In these situations, the space complexity is approx the same as time complexity. 

Remember, the space complexity is only valid if we have used any extra memory or data structure. We used Arraylist because we were asked to store the paths in the question. 

So, we have not used any extra data structure. So, the space complexity will be O(1).
