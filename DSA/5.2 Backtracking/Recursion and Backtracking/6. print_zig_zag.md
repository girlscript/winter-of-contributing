<i style="text-decofration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

In this question, we are given an integer n and are required to print a particular type of sequence of numbers.

Let's begin and have a look at the given examples.

Input 1 -> 1

Output 1 -> 1 1 1

Input 2 -> 2

Output 2 -> 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2

Input 3 -> 3

Output 3 -> 3 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 3 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 3

Now, take some time and try to figure out what is the pattern here or as we say it, what is faith and expectation ?

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

Let's analyse.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_zigzag/print_zigzag_1.png">

Analysing the output for n=3, we see that it has 5 parts :

Printed 3

Printed output for n=2

Printed 3

Printed output for n=2

Printed 3

On the basis of this analysis, we can now form our faith and expectation.

<i><b>Forming expectation : </b></i>

We expect that our code would print the given sequence as output for n=2.

<i><b>Having faith : </b></i>

Looking at the five divisions of our code, we form a faith that our code will be able to print the output for n-1. 

We don't know how it would do it, but that's what a strong faith means.

Now, let's execute.

Hope that you must have written something like this :

Which is perfectly correct, but there's a little thing missing.

The output for n=1 should be "111", let's run this code quickly for it.

Line 1 prints "1" on the console.

Output on console : "1 "

Line 2 makes a function call to pzz(0).

-- Function execution for n=0 --

Line 1 prints "0" on the console.

Output on console : "1 0 "

But did we want 0 in the output ?

NO, in fact have nothing to do when n=0. So are you telling me that we've found the BASE CASE ?

Duh, of course we've found the base case.

So, when n=0, we do nothing and return.

Output on console : "1 "

Line 3 prints "1" on the console

Output on console : "1 1 "

Line 4 makes a function call to pzz(0).

Since n=0, we hit the base case and return.

Output on console : "1 1 "

Line 5 prints "1" on the console

Output on console : "1 1 1 "

The function is executed and it wipes out of the stack and the console displays the output we required.

So, our updated code, with the base case :

```
import java.util.*;

public class zigzag {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    scn.close();
    pzz(n);
  }

  public static void pzz(int n) {
    if (n == 0)
      return;
    System.out.print(n + " ");
    pzz(n - 1);
    System.out.print(n + " ");
    pzz(n - 1);
    System.out.print(n + " ");
  }
}
```

Let's see a quick dry run for n=2.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_zigzag/print_zigzag_4.png">

pzz(2) is called from main(), thus it is placed on stack.

Line 1 does nothing as n=2.

Line 2 prints "2 ".

Line 3 calls pzz(1), and hence it gets placed on the top of the stack.

Line 1 for pzz(1) does nothing.

Line 2 prints "1 ".

Line 3 calls pzz(0)

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_zigzag/print_zigzag_5.png">

Line 1 for pzz(0) hits the base case and we return.

Line 4 of pzz(1) print "1 ".

Line 5 calls pzz(0)

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_zigzag/print_zigzag_6.png">

Line 1 for pzz(0) hits the base case and we return.

Line 6 of pzz(1) print "1 ". The function's execution for pzz(1) is complete and it wipes out from this stack.

Line 4 of pzz(2) print "2 ".

Line 5 calls pzz(1) and hence it gets placed on the top of the stack.

For execution of pzz(1), follow point 3, we just did.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_zigzag/print_zigzag_8.png">

After execution, pzz(1) wipes out from this stack.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_zigzag/print_zigzag_9.png">

Line 6 of pzz(2) prints "2 ". The function's execution for pzz(2) is complete and it wipes out from this stack, giving us the output we wanted.

This was the dry run.
