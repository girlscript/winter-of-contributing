<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

This question is a combination of the previous two questions.
 
We are required to first print the count in decreasing order (n, n-1, n-2,..,2, 1) and then in increasing order(1, 2 ,..,n-2 ,n-1).

We first need to cover High Level Thinking and Low Level Thinking to understand this problem.

Steps of High level thinking (HLT):

i) Set expectation
ii) Build Faith
ii) Meet Expectation with Faith

Steps of Low level thinking (LLT):

i) Dry run
ii) Build stack
iii) Identify Base Case

In this article we explore the HLT under the "Approach" section and the LLT under the "Analysis" section.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

Reader, we"ll consider all the three steps of HLT one by one using the figure given below.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_increasing_decreasing/print_increasing_decreasing_1.png">

<i><b>Set Expectation : </b></i>

We expect that if we input n=4 , then the output should be as shown in figure under the Expectation column .

<i><b>Build Faith : </b></i>

We must have faith that if our code can give us an output for n=4, then it can definitely give us an output for n=3. You just need to believe. Don"t focus on "HOW" that will happen.

<i><b>Expectation meets Faith : </b></i>

For printing the desired output for n=4 , we could just print the output for n=3 and print "4" before and after the output for n=3 (see figure).

The HLT uses the concept of Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI) in a way which says that:

Step 1: Check whether the given statement is true for n = 1.

Step 2: Assume that given statement P(n) is also true for n = k, where k is any positive integer.

Step 3: Prove that the result is true for P(k+1) for any positive integer k.

If the above-mentioned conditions are satisfied, then it can be concluded that P(n) is true for all n natural numbers.

Reader, can you relate our problem with the concept of PMI?

Before discussing the LLT of this problem, we want you to write a pseudo code of this program on your own. Then check our description. It would be very helpful in your understanding of recursion flow. Refer to the figure above to write it.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    pdi(n);
  }

  public static void pdi(int n) {

    if (n == 0) {                 //1
      return;
    }
    System.out.println(n);        //2
    pdi(n - 1);                   //3
    System.out.println(n);        //4
  }

}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

Reader, if we don"t have a base condition that checks if the recursive function should be called or not, the program wouldn"t know when to stop.Hence, we add a base condition to check if n reaches 0, the call is returned.

Now let"s understand the stacking process in 2 parts:

When the stack moves up i.e. pushing in stack (Till n=0)

When the moves down i.e. popping of stack (After n=0)

<i><b>1.WHEN STACK MOVES UP( OR PRINTS DECREASING)</b></i>

The pushing in the stack part of the program is depicted in 6 steps as follows:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_increasing_decreasing/print_increasing_decreasing_2.png">

The left side of the stack denotes the line numbers that have been executed (refer to code) and the circled numbers on the right side of the stack denote the output printed at each step.

Now let"s go through all the steps in detail:

The main function is executed and it calls the function pdi for n=4.

pdi function for n=4 is executed. //1 is implemented. Since n!=0 , we move on to //2 and 4 is printed as output. //3 is reached and a recursive call to n=3 is made.

pdi function for n=3 is executed. //1 is implemented. Since n!=0 , we move on to //2 and 3 is printed as output. //2 is reached and a recursive call to n=2 is made.

pdi function for n=2 is executed. //1 is implemented. Since n!=0 , we move on to //2 and 2 is printed as output. //3 is reached and a recursive call to n=1 is made.

pdi function for n=1 is executed. //1 is implemented. Since n!=0 , we move on to //2 and 1 is printed as output. //3 is reached and a recursive call to n=0 is made.

pdi function for n=0 is executed. //1 is implemented.Here, n=0 .So we return from there without executing the other lines for n=0.

Hence output till now is:

<i><b>2. WHEN STACK MOVES DOWN( OR PRINTS INCREASING)</b></i>

Now let"s go through all the steps of popping of a stack after n=0 in detail in the next 6 steps:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_increasing_decreasing/print_increasing_decreasing_4.png">

After //1 for n=0 is executed, n=0 is popped off the stack.

The function returns to //4 of n=1.Hence 1 is printed, n=1 is popped from the stack and the call reaches to n=2.

Since 3 lines of n=2 have been completed, //4 is executed .Hence 2 is printed , n=2 is popped from the stack and the call reaches to n=3.

Since 3 lines of n=3 have been completed, //4 is executed .Hence 3 is printed, n=3 is popped from the stack and the call reaches to n=4.

Since 3 lines of n=4 have been completed, //4 is executed .Hence 4 is printed and n=4 is popped from the stack .

Now all the lines of the pdi function have been called, so the command returns to the main function and the stack is empty.

The final output obtained is:

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>
O(n)

This time complexity is linear because a recursion call is made.

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>
O(1)

As no extra space is required, therefore space complexity is constant. However, if we include the space used in the recursive stack then the space complexity is O(n).

We hope that you understood the concept of Recursion successfully. In case you still face any difficulties in the solution for the problem, you may visit the complete solution [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWr4zBiRtJY).
