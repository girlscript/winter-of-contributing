<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

Now that the basic concepts of strings and ArrayLists are clear to you , let's start with our question of Subsequence.

According to the question, if we are given a string , say "abc" then we have to print all the subsequences of that string.

BUT , 

<i><b>What does a Subsequence even mean !??</b></i>

A Subsequence is a part derived from a given string which is obtained by deleting some or no elements of the given string without changing the order of the remaining elements.

So, the subsequences for our given string are a, b, c, ab, bc, ac, abc, ...

Figure 1, denotes all the subsequences of a string "abc".

The dash merely denotes that the element at that place is not chosen to be a part of that subsequence .

(*Note to reader : Notice that the order of the other elements of every subsequence remains unchanged)

(**Note to reader : Notice the blank subsequence where no elements of the given string are chosen ,we'll discuss more about it further in the article)

For a string of n length , we have 2n subsequences.

How ? you might ask. Each of the n elements of the string has 2 choices, whether to appear in the subsequence or not. Using permutations, total choices are 2*2*...till n elements = 2n subsequences.

Reader, pay attention to the figure 2,

"1" denotes that the corresponding element is present and "0" denotes that the corresponding element is not present .

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

Reader, we'll build the approach using the three steps of High Level Thinking as shown in the figure given below.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_subsequence/get_subsequence_3.png">

<i><b>Set Expectation : </b></i>

We expect that if we the string as "abc" , then the output should be as shown in figure under the Expectation column .

<i><b>Build Faith : </b></i>

We must have faith that if our code can give us an output for string "abc", then it can definitely give us an output for string "bc". You just need to believe. Don"t focus on "HOW" that will happen.

<i><b>Expectation meets Faith : </b></i>

For printing the desired subsequences for string "abc" , we could just print first " "(space) and then "a" before all the subsequences of "bc" (see figure).

As you can see in Figure 3, output for "abc" can be found if output for "bc" is known. Before discussing the LLT of this problem, we will discuss the code.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    String str = scn.next();
    ArrayList< String> res = gss(str);
    System.out.println(res);
  }

  //bc ->  [ --,-c ,b-, bc ]
  //abc->  [ ---,--c, -b-, -bc, a--,ab-,abc]

  public static ArrayList< String> gss(String str) {
    if (str.length() == 0) {
      ArrayList< String> bres = new ArrayList< >();           //1
      bres.add("");
      return base;
    }
    char ch = str.charAt(0);                                      //2
    String ros = str.substring(1);                                //3

    ArrayList< String> rres = gss(ros);                            //4
    ArrayList< String> mres = new ArrayList< >();                   //5
    for (String val : rres) {
      mres.add("" + val);                                       //6
    }
    for (String val : rres) {
      mres.add(ch + val);                                       //7
    }

    return mres;                                                  //8
  }

}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>CODE DISCUSSION</b></i>

<i><b>Base Case: </b></i>

If the string length reaches 0, then a new ArrayList bres is created .A blank is added to it and it is returned. There is 1 subsequence of a blank string which is also a blank.

We separate the first element i.e. "a" of the given string and store it in char ch.

Next we store the remaining part of the given string i.e "bc" in the string ros.

The function gss is recursively called on ros and we have faith that it will provide us the subsequences for string "bc".
We create a new ArrayList mres in which the final output will be stored.

We apply a for loop for every subsequence of "bc" which is stored in rres and first add a blank before each of them eventually add it in our final ArrayList mres.

Again we apply a for loop for every subsequence of "bc" and add ch( i.e."a" in this case) before each of them and eventually add it in our final ArrayList mres.

At last, we return our final ArrayList mres where the output for "abc" is stored.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis </b></i>

We now begin with our Low Level Thinking. For that let's dry run our code in 2 parts. The numbers on the left side of the figures represent the code lines that have been run( refer the above code).

While going up the path

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_subsequence/get_subsequence_5.png">

As we discussed in the code , we separate a and bc and recursively call the function on bc.
Again, bc gets separated into b and c and a recursion call on c is made.
Then in the next recursive call, c is stored in ch but ros is a blank ,so a call is made on an empty string.
Due to the base case , we know that a blank string returns an ArrayList with 1 element which is a blank element.
While going down the path

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_subsequence/get_subsequence_6.png">

A blank is returned to "c" and using the for loop , a " " (blank) and a char "ch"( i.e "c" here) are added to the output . Then //8 runs and the output is returned to bc. This goes on until the recursive call moves back to "abc".
Now the final output of "abc" is " ","c" , "b" ,"bc","a", "ac" ,"ab" , "abc" .

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>
O(n)

This time complexity is linear because a recursion call is made along with using "for loop".

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>
O(1)

As no extra space is required, therefore space complexity is constant. However, if we include the space used in the recursive stack then the space complexity is O(n).

We highly recommend you to watch the "Get Subsequence" Solution video for a better understanding of the problem.

Here, we come to the end of this question. We hope you were able to understand the first question under the topic of "Recursion using ArrayLists". We'll be practicing more questions on this topic in the next few articles, so go through them once this question is fully clear to you. Till then, Goodbye !
