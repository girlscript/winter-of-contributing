<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

A person is standing on the nth floor of a staircase and wants to come to the 0th floor.

At a time he can go 1, 2 or 3 steps down.

You have to print all the paths that can be used to climb down the staircase.

For example, if n=3, then all the paths are 111, 12, 21, 3.

Figure 1 shows some of the paths that can be taken by a person to climb down the stairs for n=3.

You can also refer to the question video of this problem.

[video](https://youtu.be/W6cT68K7Hls).

We need to clear one thing first, if S denotes the source and D denotes the destination, and if there are

x ways to go from a to D
y ways to go from b to D
z ways to go from c to D

Then for going from S to D we will have x+y+z approaches.

According to this, let's try to redraw the figure 2 as per the given question for say, n=7.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_stair_paths/get_stair_paths_3.png">

Initially with a jump of 1 or 2 or 3 we can move to the (n-1) or (n-2) or (n-3) step i.e. 6, 5 and 4 in this case.

Then from there we calculate the paths required to move to the 0th step. Some examples of such paths are shown in figure 3.

(Note: The paths from n to 0 will be the same as the paths from 0 to n. Can you think why?)

Hence, the total paths from S to D will be total paths from (6 to 0) + (5 to 0) + (4 to 0).

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

We will go through all the 3 steps of High Level Thinking one at a time.

<i><b>Set Expectation : </b></i>

We expect that we will get all the paths from n to 0.

<i><b>Build Faith : </b></i>

We must have faith that if our code can give us all the paths from n to 0, then it can definitely give us all the paths from (n-1) to 0 , (n-2) to 0 and (n-3) to 0. You just need to believe. Don"t focus on "HOW" that will happen.

<i><b>Expectation meets Faith : </b></i>

For printing the desired output for n, we could just add "1" to all the paths for (n-1) , "2" to all the paths for (n-2) and "3" to all the paths for (n-3).

We would like you to write the code of this problem yourself first, just to practice your recursion skills that you have developed in the previous recursive problems.

Now let's start building the code .

Look at the code given below. What do you think the output should be?

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    ArrayList< String> paths = getStairPaths(n);
    System.out.println(paths);
  }

  public static ArrayList< String> getStairPaths(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {                                      //1.1
      ArrayList< String> bres = new ArrayList< >();
      bres.add("");
      return bres;
    } else if (n < 0) {
      ArrayList< String> bres = new ArrayList< >();         //1.2
      return bres;
    }

    ArrayList< String> path1 = getStairPaths(n - 1);         //2.1
    ArrayList< String> path2 = getStairPaths(n - 2);         //2.2
    ArrayList< String> path3 = getStairPaths(n - 3);         //2.3

    ArrayList< String> paths = new ArrayList< >();            //3

    for (String path : paths1) {
      paths.add("1" + path);                               //4.1
    }
    for (String path : path2) {
      paths.add("2" + path);                               //4.2
    }
    for (String path : path3) {
      paths.add("3" + path);                               //4.3
    }
    return paths;                                           //5

  }

}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Code Discussion </b></i>

<i><b>Base Case:</b></i>

If the string length reaches 0, then a new ArrayList bres is created. A blank path is added to it and the list is returned. Here we have 1 way to go from 0th step to 0th step. That way is to keep standing there. This is called the <i><b>Positive Base Case</b></i>.

When n<0, it means that there are no stairs left and the person will be going into the basement which isn"t practically possible. Here, we don"t add any path to the ArrayList. This is called the <i><b>Negative Base Case</b></i>.

<i><b>Recursive call on getStairPaths: </b></i>

We call the function getStairPaths on (n-1) which gives us all the paths from (n- 1) to 0 and we then store them in ArrayList "path1".

Next, we call the function getStairPaths on (n-2) which gives us all the paths from (n- 2) to 0 and which are then stored in ArrayList "path2".

Similarly, the function getStairPaths is called on (n-3) which gives us all the paths from (n- 3) to 0 and which are then stored in ArrayList "path3".

We declare a new ArrayList "paths" which stores all the final paths from n to 0.

<i><b>Meeting Expectation from Faith:</b></i>

To every path of ArrayList "path1", "1" is added.

To every path of ArrayList "path2", "2" is added.

To every path of ArrayList "path3", "3" is added.

The ArrayList containing all the paths from n to 0 is returned.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Recursive Tree</b></i>

Reader, draw a recursive tree for n=4. Then tally your tree with ours.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_stair_paths/get_stair_paths_5.png">

The numbers beside the edges denote the steps taken and the numbers at the vertices denote the floor a person is at.

Here, we only consider those paths which reach till n=0.

As we have already discussed, the paths which go below the 0th floor i.e. are negative are practically not possible so we don"t count them in our answer.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Euler Path </b></i>

Let's trace the Euler path for the tree in figure 5 .

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/get_stair_paths/get_stair_paths_6.png">

Here, the Euler path is traced by green highlighter and you can see all the valid paths written at the top in brackets.

In figure 6, you can see that as we move from n=4 to the subsequent levels up and reach the last level where n=0 , the path along the edges of all the levels is printed. The stack is filled at each level according to this Euler path.

Now that the path falls back on the previous level, the answer is printed and the last level is popped from the stack.

As the Euler path then moves up a level again, the new level gets pushed into the stack once again. This process of popping, pushing and printing keeps going on until all the paths have been printed.

When we reach the last answer on the tree, the path keeps moving down all the levels and the stack keeps popping until it is ultimately left empty.

We highly recommend you to go through the solution video of "Get Stair Paths" in order to understand the working of the recursion tree better.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>
O(3n)

This time complexity is exponential because for each state, 3 recursion calls are made.

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>
O(1)

As no extra space is required, therefore space complexity is constant. However, if we include the space used in the recursive stack then the space complexity is O(n).

With this we conclude our problem "Get Stair Paths". Further along the lectures, we"ll study more approaches to solve this problem. Until then, Goodbye.
