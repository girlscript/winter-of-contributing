<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

The problem states that we have been given an array and we have to find the largest element in the array using recursion. 

Remember that the size of the array cannot be zero i.e. there will be at least one element in the array. You may watch the question video to understand the problem. 

An example for the same is shown below:

<i><b>Constraints given in the problem are:</b></i>

size of the array (n) = 1 <= n <= 104

each element of the array= 0 <= n1,n2...n <=109

Well, this is a pretty basic problem but it will enhance your understanding of recursion. 

The online judge cannot force you to write your code using recursion, but you are here to understand recursion only. 

So, please solve this problem using recursion and don"t use a loop to do it. Now think of the solution!!!!

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

<i><b>High-Level thinking</b></i>

<i>What is the <b>expectation</b> and <b>faith?</b></i>

Dear reader, by now you must be familiar with these steps of Low and High-Level thinking. Try to think about the expectation, faith and their relation yourself!!!.

<i><b>Expectation: </b></i>Our expectation is clear, to find the maximum element inside the array.

<i><b>Faith: </b></i>Now comes the interesting part. Look at the diagram shown below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/max_of_an_array/max_of_an_array_2.png">

The faith that we can establish is that our function will be able to find the maximum value from index 1 to the end of the array i.e. the smaller array. As shown in fig-2, our function was able to find the max in the smaller array i.e. 9. Now we just have to compare it with arr[0] to find out the maximum value of the array.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Relation:</b></i>

So, we just have to compare the max element obtained from the smaller/remaining part of the array with the first element of the array. This will be our recurrence relation too.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/max_of_an_array/max_of_an_array_3.png">

So, you can now write a few lines of code based on the recurrence relation. But this code will not be complete and will givo a TLE (Time Limit Exceed) error. Why? Think!!!

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Low-Level Thinking</b></i>

If you are not clear with anything which has been discussed till now, you are requested to watch the solution video to clear your doubts. Now, let us dry run the code that we have written. Have a look at the diagram given below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/max_of_an_array/max_of_an_array_4.png">

<i><b>Going deep: </b></i>

The above diagram shows each and every step of the recursive code while we are moving up the recursion. You are requested to understand this diagram with the code carefully. 

This will give you the best insight into recursion. We started by passing 0 in the idx when we called max(a,idx) in the main function. Therefore the idx variable, (shortened for "i" in the diagram) is initially at 0.

Now the first line of code runs which is calling the function max(arr,idx+1). The execution of this line is denoted by a white-colored dot in front of i=0 in the stack. 

Since the first line was a recursive call, another instance of the function is created above the previous instance which is for i=1 (since the call was max(arr,i+1)).

Again, the first line of code executes and a call is made to i=2 and the execution of the first line for i=1 is shown by a white dot. Similarly, the next calls are made and we reach i=4.

Now, this is the last element of the array. After this element, there is no element left inside it. And now if the call is made for i=5, then "i" exceeds the array and this is wrong. 

So, we have to return from this call when "i" becomes equal to 4. 

In general, when "i" reaches array.length-1, we have to return and start going down in the recursion. 

If we don"t return from here then recursive calls will continue and the stack will overflow. Have a look at the diagram given below (fig-5)

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/max_of_an_array/max_of_an_array_5.png">

<i><b>Coming out: </b></i>

The above diagram explains the scenario of coming out of recursion or moving down the stack. As discussed, when "i" reaches 4, we have to return. 

But, we don"t just return this time, we return a value also which is the largest value inside the array. When we are at i=4, we return the value at i=4 as the max value. So, a[4]=2 is the max answer till now.
Then we are at one level down where i=3. 

Please have a look at the code, it is after the recursion call that we compare the elements. 

So, we will now compare the elements and we find that the element a[i]=a[3]=6 is greater than the max value=2 that we got from the previous call. So, we return a[3]=6 to the next call to compare the value with.

Now, we are at i=2 and a[2]=9 is greater than 6, so 9 gets returned to the next call.

We now reach i=1 but a[1]=4 is less than 9 so, 9 is returned to the next call.

We finally reach i=0. The value of a[0]=8 is less than 9. So 9 will be returned to the main function which is called our max(arr, i) function. 

There we will print the value and after the complete execution, the main function will also wipe out from the stack and it will be empty. 

Now that we know the base case and have analyzed the recursion completely, let"s write the code for the problem. 

Also, if you have any problems understanding the above, refer to the solution video to resolve your queries.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Pseudo Code</b></i>

<i><b>High-Level Thinking: </b></i>

Establish the relationship between expectation and faith. We expect that we have to find the max(arr,0) meaning the largest element of the array starting from position 0. 

Our faith will be that we can find the max(arr,1) i.e. the maximum of the remaining part of the array i.e. from index 1 to array.size()-1.

<i><b>Write Recursive Relation: </b></i>

Since we know our expectation and faith we can now, very easily compare the arr[0] with the max(arr,1) i.e if arr[0]>max(arr,1), arr[0] will be the max otherwise max(arr,1) will be the max.

<i><b>Low-Level Thinking: </b></i>

Now we will try to dry run the recursive code and see the levels inside the call stack, then we will try to find out the base case for the recursion i.e. if we reach a state when only one element is present in the array then it will be the max. 

So max(arr,arr.length-1) is the final call and i=arr.length-1 is the base case.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();

    int []a = new int[n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
      a[i] = scn.nextInt();
    }
    int max = maxOfArray(a, 0);
    System.out.println(max);

  }

  public static int maxOfArray(int[] arr, int idx) {

    if (idx >= arr.length)
    {
      return Integer.MIN_VALUE;  //we have the constraint that the size of array will not be zero hence we have not considered that case here
    }

    int misa = maxOfArray(arr, idx + 1); //misa stands for maximum in smaller array

    if (arr[idx] > misa)
    {
      return arr[idx];
    }
    return misa;

  }

}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis </b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>

The time complexity of the above solution is O(n). This is because we have iterated the array twice. 

Once while going into the recursion and the other time while coming out of it. 

So, n elements were visited twice: n+n= 2n, O(2n)=O(n).

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>

The space complexity will be O(1) as we have not used any extra space. 

If we consider the recursion space, it will be O(n) i.e. the maximum height of the recursion stack.
