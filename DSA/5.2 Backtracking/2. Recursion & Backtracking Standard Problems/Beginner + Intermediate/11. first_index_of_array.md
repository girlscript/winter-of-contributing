<i><b>Question Link : </b></i>[Click](https://www.pepcoding.com/resources/online-java-foundation/recursion-in-arrays/first-index-official/ojquestion).

The question states that we have to return the first index of occurrence of a particular element in the array and if the element is not in the array we have to return -1. Have a look at the diagram given below:

So, you have to solve this problem using recursion and don"t use loops as you are learning recursion and these problems are going to improve your concepts. 

Now think about the solution yourself!!!

<i style="text-decoration: underline"></b>Approach : </b></i>

At first, try to solve this problem by yourself. Think about the expectation and faith and establish a relation between them.

<i><b>High-Level thinking </b></i>

So, did you think about the solution? Let"s start our discussion now.

<i><b>Expectation: </b></i>

Our expectation is to get the first index of occurrence of a particular element in the array.

<i><b>Faith: </b></i>

We have a faith that recursion can solve the smaller version of the same problem. 

We expect that recursion should give us the first index of occurrence of a particular value when we pass a smaller array i.e. firstIndex(arr,1,data). 

So, this should give us the first index of occurrence of a particular value from 1 to array.length-1.( Look at the figure shown below)

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/first_index_of_occurrence/first_index_of_occurrence_2.png">

<i style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Relation:  </b></i>

Our recursive function found the first index of occurrence of data=3 inside the array starting from index 1 upto index 11. 

Then we checked whether a[0] was equal to data or not. Since a[0] was also 3 we got the answer as 0, as it is the first index of occurrence of 3. 

Did this method ring any bells in your mind? Is there something wrong with this method? Think!!!!

So, let"s do the low-level thinking and find out the base case for the problem.

<i style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Low-Level Thinking </b></i>

We will now do the low level thinking for the above code to find out the base case of the recursion. 

You may refer to the solution video if you have any doubts in the high-level thinking procedure of the question. 

Now, let us try to dry run the code that we have written already and see the stack diagram:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/first_index_of_occurrence/first_index_of_occurrence_3.png">

<i><b>Going up in the recursion: </b></i>

The above diagram (fig-3) shows the full recursive procedure and stack at each recursive call when we move up in the recursion. 

We are trying to find the first index of value 3. 

We recommend you to have the code (written above) by your side and try to analyze this diagram with your full concentration. 

You have already understood such stack diagrams in the previous questions therefore it should not be difficult. 

We started with variable idx=0. When the first line of the code executes, a recursive call is made i.e. 

fiisa=firstIndex(arr,idx+1,x), and another instance of function for idx=1 is created. 

The fact that the first line of function for idx=1 has been executed is shown in the diagram with the help of a white dot. 

Similarly, the next calls are made and we reach idx=4 (moving step by step). 

Now we have reached the end of the array. So, there is no logic in checking the availability of variable x after this index. 

So, the idx gets incremented, but we have to return when idx reaches 5 and this will be our base case.


<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Base Case: </b></i>

When (idx=arr.length) then return.

<Img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/first_index_of_occurrence/first_index_of_occurrence_4.png">

<i><b>Coming Out of Recursion: </b></i>

Since we reached the end of the array, we have to come back out of the recursion. 

So, we have to return and till now we have not executed any statement which finds the first index of 3 in this array. 

So, when we return, we have to return with a value of -1. Now we are at idx=4.The value here is 2 which is not what we are looking for. So, we will still return -1 to the next function call. 

Now, we are at idx=3 and the value a[idx]=a[3]=3. 

Therefore, we have found the first index of 3 which is the first index till idx=3. So, we return 3 to the next call and we reach idx=2. 

Since a[2] is not equal to 3, we move forward wiping out this instance of the function from the stack. 

Now, we are at idx=1 and the value a[1]=3 so we have found another occurrence of 3 and till here it should be the first occurrence. So, we will return 1. 

Now, we reach idx=0. Since a[0] is not equal to 3, we return 1to the main function. 

<i style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Correction In Our Approach </b></i>

So, do you remember we asked you about this method being perfect when we established the relation between faith and expectation? 

Well, this method actually has a flaw. Look at the diagram given below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/first_index_of_occurrence/first_index_of_occurrence_5.png">

This diagram shows that when we went into recursion we traversed the array completely and we were not comparing the value of a[i] with our required value. 

Therefore, we had to traverse the entire array back to make sure that we do not miss out on the correct position of the first index of that value. 

Instead, we should have compared while going into the recursion and if we would have found the value,, we would stop there only. This is the better approach as depicted by the diagram below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/first_index_of_occurrence/first_index_of_occurrence_6.png">

So, what we should do is that we should compare the values first before making the recursion call. You may watch the solution video if you have any doubts regarding this. Note that the approach we followed earlier was also logically correct but it was just not the best way to do it. You get it, right?

So, now that we have analyzed everything let"s move to the code.

<i style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Pseudo Code </b></i>

<i><b>High-Level Thinking: </b></i>

Establish a faith and then establish a relationship between faith and expectation. 

Our expectation is that we need to find the first index of occurrence of an element in the array. 

So we expect that firstIndex(arr,0,data) finds the first index of occurrence of data variable by looking at the complete array and firstIndex(arr,1,data) finds the first index of occurrence of data in the array but it starts looking from 1.

<i><b>Write Recursive Relation: </b></i>

We know that we have found the first index of occurrence of data by firstIndex(arr,1,data). 

Now just compare arr[0] with data and if(arr[0]==data) return 0 else return firstIndex(arr,1,data).

<i><b>Low-Level Thinking: </b></i>

Now dry the above code using recursion stack and find out the base case which will come out to be i=array.length-1. Write in the code as well to stop the recursion. 

Else the call stack will overflow leading to Run Time Error.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    int[] arr = new int[n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      arr[i] = scn.nextInt();
    }
    int x = scn.nextInt();
    int fi = firstIndex(arr, 0, x);
    System.out.println(fi);
  }

  public static int firstIndex(int[] arr, int idx, int x) {

    if (idx == arr.length)
    {
      return -1;
    }


    if (arr[idx] == x)
    {
      return idx;
    }

    int fiisa = firstIndex(arr, idx + 1, x);

    return fiisa;
  }

}
```

<i style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Analysis </b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity : </b></i>

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) as we are traversing an array and searching for an element.

<i><b>Space Complexity : </b></i>

As you know from the previous questions, since we did not take any extra memory, the space complexity is O(1), but if we consider stack space then it is O(n).

We hope that you understood the concept successfully. In case you still face any difficulties in the solution for the problem, you may visit the complete solution [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU0xUG9eO3Y).
