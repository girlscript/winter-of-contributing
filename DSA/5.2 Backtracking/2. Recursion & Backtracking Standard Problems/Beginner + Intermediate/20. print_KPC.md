Now that you have gone through "Get Subsequence", let"s discuss why there is even a need for a second approach?

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_Kpc/print_kpc_2.png">

We are supposed to print all the keypad combinations of a given string according to the key to the character map as shown in Figure 1.

<i><b>Question Link :</b></i>[Link](https://www.pepcoding.com/resources/online-java-foundation/recursion-on-the-way-up/print-kpc-official/ojquestion).

Now that you have gone through "Get KPC", let"s see how it is different from "Print KPC".

In "Get KPC" we had to store all the combinations in an ArrayList and as we have already discussed in "Print Subsequences", this method takes a huge amount of memory (2n-1 * n). 

However, in this question we are simply required to print each combination without storing all the elements at one place.

If we are given an input of "678", the following map has to be followed:

According to these combinations the answer should be ptv, ptw, ptx, qtv, qtw, qtx, rtv, rtw, rtx, stv, stw and stx.

Here the total number of combinations will be: 4 x 2 x 3=24 , where 4, 3 and 2 are the number of characters corresponding to each element of the input string.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

<i><b>Recursion Tree </b></i>


We also call this method of drawing the tree as the "Levels and Options" method because the problem is solved at each level by considering 2 options of YES/NO at every level.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_Kpc/print_kpc_4.png">

In this tree the number strings represent the questions , the strings to the right side of questions are the answers and the characters along the edges are the options of the first character of the question string.

Here, from the original string of "678", we consider the first character "6" which has 4 options that are, p, q, r and s. These options keep getting added to the answer string.

For each of these options, the question left is "78". Here the first character "7" has 2 options of t and u.

Then, jumping to the next level, the question left will be "8". Here, the options for the first character, which is "8" itself are v, w and x.

Moving on, the question string is now empty, hence we print all the final answer combinations.

<i><b>Euler Path : </b></i>

Now that we have made a recursive tree let"s understand how we travel through it .
<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_Kpc/print_kpc_5.png">

The path highlighted in red is the Euler path for this inverted tree.

In figure 4, you can see that we move from "678" i.e. level 1 to level 2 to level 3 and then reach the last level where the question string is empty .

Hence, the answer is printed. The stack is filled at each of these levels.

Now that the path falls back on the previous level, last level is popped from the stack.

As the Euler path moves up a level, the new level gets pushed into the stack once again.

This process of popping, pushing and printing keeps going on until all the combinations have been printed.

When the path reaches the last combination, i.e. "sux" it keeps moving down all the levels and the stack keeps popping until it is ultimately left empty.

We really want you to attempt the coding part of this question on your own. If your face any difficulties, refer to the code below.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    String str = scn.next();
    printKPC(str, "");
  }

  static String[] codes = {".;", "abc", "def", "ghi", "jkl", "mno", "pqrs", "tu", "vwx",
                           "yz"
                          };                                                          //1

  public static void printKPC(String ques, String ans) {
    if (ques.length() == 0)                                    //2
    {
      System.out.println(ans);
      return;
    }
    char ch = ques.charAt(0);                                   //3
    String roq = ques.substring(1);                             //4
    String codeforch = codes[ch - "0"];                         //5
    for (int i = 0; i < codeforch.length(); i++)                 //6
    {
      char cho = codeforch.charAt(i);
      printKPC(roq, ans + cho);                                 //7
    }

  }
}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>CODE DISCUSSION</b></i>

We form a global array of strings called "codes" which store the key to character elements where key is the index of the string and characters are the characters of the string at that index.

<i><b>Base Case: </b></i>

If the ques length reaches 0, then we print the answer and return the function.

We separate the first element i.e. "6" of the given string and store it in char ch.

Next we store the remaining part of the given string i.e "78" in the string roq.

In coding , "6" != 6 . The former is a character 6 and latter is an integer 6. So to convert the character into an integer and store it in "codeforch".

We iterate a loop from 0 to the length-1 of string corresponding to codeforch to get index of each character of that string.For example, if chodeforch=6 then loop iterates from 0 to 3 to get the characters p, q, r and s.

The function printKPC is recursively called on roq i.e. 78 as the "ques" and "ans" as the sum of previous answer and character corresponding to cho (i.e. character at each index of the string corresponding to codeforch) .

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>
O(2n)

This time complexity is exponential.

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>
O(1)

As no extra space is required, therefore space complexity is constant. However, if we include the space used in the recursive stack then the space complexity is O(n).

We hope that you understood the concept successfully. In case you still face any difficulties in the solution for the problem, you may visit the complete solution [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke8TPhHdHMw).

Happy Coding!
