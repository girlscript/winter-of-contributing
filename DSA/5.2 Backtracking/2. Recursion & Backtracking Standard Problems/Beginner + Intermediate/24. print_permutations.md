<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Discussion :</b></i>

This problem is a little bit different from the problems we have been solving in this section. 

The problem states that you have been given a string and you have to print all permutations of a string. 

Have a look at the diagram given below to understand the problem better:

A string "abc" was given as the input and its permutations are as shown. 

We have also dropped a little hint about the number of permutations.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach :</b></i>

<i><b>Choosing one character: </b></i>

As we already told you, this problem is a little different from the other problems. 

In other problems like PRINT SUBSEQUENCES, we were to select a few characters from the strings. 

But, permutation means that we will have all the characters of the string but their order will be different from each other. It all depends on which character is chosen first. 

Have a look at the figure given below:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_permutation/print_permutation_2.png">

The string had three characters namely 'a', 'b' and 'c'. 

We can choose either one of them first as shown in the figure. If we choose 'a' then our string will start with 'a'. 

But, we have not yet chosen the second and third characters, so we don't know what our string will be. It can either be "abc" or "acb", depending upon the order of choosing the characters in the next level. 

Similarly, if we choose 'b' as the first character, we don't know whether our string will be "bac" or whether it will be "bca". Similar is the case with choosing 'c'.

Moving to the next Level: Dear reader, we request you to watch the question video to understand the given diagram and then come back to the article, this will help you understand it in a better way.

We started with the string "abc". 

We have to select the first character that will be the first character of our permutation. We can select from 'a', 'b' or 'c'. 

The question string "abc" is on the 0th level in the tree. 

Now, if we select 'a' as the first character, our string will start with 'a'. Also, since we have selected 'a' as the first character and we are printing the permutations of "abc", 'a' will now never come in the string again. Why? Think!!!

Since 'a' was selected as the first character of the string, the question string now becomes 'bc' i.e. for the upcoming characters, we will select from "bc" only. 

This is shown in the second level of the tree, where the numerator shows the remaining question and the denominator shows the answer so far.

The same will happen if we select 'b' as our first character of the string. We will have only "ac" as the remaining question and 'b' will become the first character of the answer or the answer so far. 

The same happens for 'c' as well.So, this is how we keep on selecting a character from the string and removing it from the question string and appending it to the answer string. The question string is always shown in the numerator and the answer string is shown in the denominator.

You may refer to the solution [video](https://youtu.be/sPAT_DbvDj0) (0:16-0:49) and (1:33-2:11) to clear your doubts for the above part if any.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Identifying the Base Case:/ Dry Run till Base Case:</b></i>

My friend, you are requested to keep the code above by your side and understand the dry running of the above procedure step by step to reach the base case and get the answer.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_permutation/print_permutation_4.png">

We have started with the string "abc". If we choose 'a' as the first character then, a will be the answer so far and the remaining question will be "bc". 

You can see that leftPart will not contain any character when we use the str.substring(0,i) in our code. It is not necessary that we have selected 'a' as the first character. 

We could have selected 'b' or even 'c' as our first character. The same is represented in the diagram. The numerator is the question left after selecting that particular character and the denominator is the answer so far after including that particular character in our answer.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_permutation/print_permutation_5.png">

After the selection of the first character, we have to choose the remaining. So, after choosing 'a' as the first character, we had "bc" left as the question string. 

So, we can now select either 'b' or 'c' as the next character. If we choose 'b', the answer so-far becomes "ab" and the question remaining is "c". 

If we choose 'c' as the next character, the question remaining is "b". The same procedure is followed for the strings with initial characters 'b' and 'c' also.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_permutation/print_permutation_6.png">

After this, we are left with only one character remaining in our question string and we have no choice but to take this character now and make it a part of our answer. 

So we take that remaining character and we don't have anything remaining in our question. This is the base case and obviously, we have to return from here. 

The entire flow of recursion is shown with the help of the Euler path in the diagram below. 

You are requested to trace the Euler path by yourself and try to understand the flow of recursion by keeping a copy of the above code with you.

Now that we have the complete knowledge of the base case and have understood the complete flow of recursion, let us write the base case and complete our code.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    String str = scn.next();

    printPermutations(str, "");

  }

  public static void printPermutations(String str, String asf) {

    if (str.length() == 0)
    {
      System.out.println(asf); //Question string is empty so print the answer now and return
      return ;
    }
    //Extracting each character at a time from the question string and appending it to answer so far
    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++)
    {
      char ch = str.charAt(i);
      String leftPart = str.substring(0, i); //Substring from 0 to i-1 (left to ch)
      String rightPart = str.substring(i + 1); //Substring from i+1 till end of String (right to ch)
      String roq = leftPart + rightPart; //Remaining string after extracting ch
      printPermutations(roq, asf + ch);
    }

  }
}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity :</b></i>

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/print_permutation/print_permutation_8.png">

In the code, we are having the function printPermutations(str,asf). Initially, the length of the question is n and the length of the asf string is 0. 

So, the time complexity function for this printPermutations(str,asf) is denoted by T(n,0).

We have a loop in the code that runs for n times as the length of the question string is n. 

Now, the call is made where we have extracted 1 character from the question string and added 1 to the answer string. So the length of the question string is now n-1 and the answer string length is 1. 

This loop is running for n times and hence we get our equation shown in the diagram (fig-8). Now, the further calculations are all mathematics, try to understand the derivation of time complexity.

Therefore, the time complexity of the above problem is O(n!).

<i><b>Space Complexity :</b></i>

The space complexity of the above problem is O(1) as we have not used any extra space or data structure.
