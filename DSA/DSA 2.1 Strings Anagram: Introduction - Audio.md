# Strings Anagram

## What is Strings Anagram

An anagram of the string is another string that contains the same characters,but only the order of characters can be different. 

## Algorithm to check two Strings are Anagram or not

* Check the length of both strings, if they are equal the  we proceed further otherwise return from function.
* As the size of both strings are same then we have to sort both strings separately.
* Check if the sorted strings are same or not. If same then its anagram otherwise not anagram.
