# LIFO vs FIFO Approach

LIFO is last in first out and FIFO is first in first out. Data Structures such as Stacks are based on LIFO principle which means the element inserted at the last, is the first element to come out of the list for example :- Call logs in mobile phones uses stack or LIFO principle, to geta first person call log you have to scroll. Where as queues are based on FIFO principle which means the element inserted at the first, is the first element to come out of the list. A real world example for this approach can be a single line
road or one way road where the vehicle enter first, exits first and the another real world example can be seen as queues at the ticket window and bus stops or railway stations.
