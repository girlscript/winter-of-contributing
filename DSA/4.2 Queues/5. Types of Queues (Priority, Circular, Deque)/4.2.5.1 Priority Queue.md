# Priority Queue
A priority queue is an abstract data type that behaves similarly to the normal queue except that each element has some priority, i.e., the element with the highest priority would come first in a priority queue. The priority of the elements in a priority queue will determine the order in which elements are removed from the priority queue.

The priority queue supports only comparable elements, which means that the elements are either arranged in an ascending or descending order.

For example, suppose we have some values like 1, 3, 4, 8, 14, 22 inserted in a priority queue with an ordering imposed on the values is from least to the greatest. Therefore, the 1 number would be having the highest priority while 22 will be having the lowest priority.


### Characteristics of a Priority queue

1. A priority queue is an extension of a queue that contains the following characteristics:

2. Every element in a priority queue has some priority associated with it.

3. An element with the higher priority will be deleted before the deletion of the lesser priority.

4. If two elements in a priority queue have the same priority, they will be arranged using the FIFO principle.

<b>Let's understand the priority queue through an example.</b>

We have a priority queue that contains the following values:

1, 3, 4, 8, 14, 22

All the values are arranged in ascending order. Now, we will observe how the priority queue will look after performing the following operations:

- poll(): This function will remove the highest priority element from the priority queue. In the above priority queue, the '1' element has the highest priority, so it will be removed from the priority queue.

- add(2): This function will insert '2' element in a priority queue. As 2 is the smallest element among all the numbers so it will obtain the highest priority.

- poll(): It will remove '2' element from the priority queue as it has the highest priority queue.

- add(5): It will insert 5 element after 4 as 5 is larger than 4 and lesser than 8, so it will obtain the third highest priority in a priority queue.

### Types of Priority Queue

There are two types of priority queue:

1. Ascending order priority queue: In ascending order priority queue, a lower priority number is given as a higher priority in a priority. For example, we take the numbers from 1 to 5 arranged in an ascending order like 1,2,3,4,5; therefore, the smallest number, i.e., 1 is given as the highest priority in a priority queue.

2. Descending order priority queue: In descending order priority queue, a higher priority number is given as a higher priority in a priority. For example, we take the numbers from 1 to 5 arranged in descending order like 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; therefore, the largest number, i.e., 5 is given as the highest priority in a priority queue.

### Priority Queue Operations

The common operations that we can perform on a priority queue are insertion, deletion and peek. Let's see how we can maintain the heap data structure.

<b>Inserting the element in a priority queue (max heap)</b>

If we insert an element in a priority queue, it will move to the empty slot by looking from top to bottom and left to right.

If the element is not in a correct place then it is compared with the parent node; if it is found out of order, elements are swapped. This process continues until the element is placed in a correct position.

<b>Removing the minimum element from the priority queue</b>

As we know that in a max heap, the maximum element is the root node. When we remove the root node, it creates an empty slot. The last inserted element will be added in this empty slot. Then, this element is compared with the child nodes, i.e., left-child and right child, and swap with the smaller of the two. It keeps moving down the tree until the heap property is restored.

### Applications of Priority queue

- It is used in the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
- It is used in prim's algorithm
- It is used in data compression techniques like Huffman code.
- It is used in heap sort.
- It is also used in operating system like priority scheduling, load balancing and interrupt handling.

### Program for Priority Queue

    class PriorityQueue(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.queue = []

        def __str__(self):
            return ' '.join([str(i) for i in self.queue])

        # for checking if the queue is empty
        def isEmpty(self):
            return len(self.queue) == 0

        # for inserting an element in the queue
        def insert(self, data):
            self.queue.append(data)

        # for popping an element based on Priority
        def delete(self):
            try:
                max = 0
                for i in range(len(self.queue)):
                    if self.queue[i] > self.queue[max]:
                        max = i
                item = self.queue[max]
                del self.queue[max]
                return item
            except IndexError:
                print()
                exit()

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        myQueue = PriorityQueue()
        myQueue.insert(12)
        myQueue.insert(1)
        myQueue.insert(14)
        myQueue.insert(7)
        print(myQueue)            
        while not myQueue.isEmpty():
            print(myQueue.delete()) 
            
   Output:
   
        12 1 14 7
        14
        12
        7
        1

Note that the time complexity of delete is O(n) in the above code.

A better implementation is to use Binary Heap which is typically used to implement priority queue. Note that Python provides heapq in library also.

By using heap datastructure to implement Priority Queues, Time complexity:
Insert Operation: O(log(n))
Delete Operation: O(log(n))
