# **Circular Queue**

## **What is Circular Queue**
    A Queue is a standard data structure which follow the FIFO(First In First Out) principle. A Queue is a linear data structure and it is also known as Circular Buffer or Ring Buffer. A Circular Queue has a fixed size and it is connected from its both end so that its memory can be used efficiently.

## **Advantages:**
- It takes less memory as compared to the Linear Queue.
- We can traverse multiple time over a same memory block, if we do multiple insertion and deletion.
- If we do regular deletion, then infinite insertion can be possible.

## **Disadvantages:**
- We cannot store more elements than the size of Circular Queue.
- Complex implementation as compared to Linear Queue.

## **Explanation of algorithm:**.
    A Circular Queue will have two pointers, front pointer and the rear pointer. Initial both the pointer will be at -1 and when the very first element will be inserted in a Circular Queue, both the pointer will increment and come to 0. Now front pointer will take care of the removal of elements from the Circular Queue and rear pointer will take care for insertion an element at rear.
    When the rear pointer reaches at the end, the index of rear pointer won't exceed the Circular Queue size, and insert the data at rear:
```cpp
    this->rear = (this->rear+1)%this->capacity;
	this->arr[this->rear] = data;
```
    
    And inorder to remove the data, the data present at front will gets removed and front pointer will gets incremented so that it won't exceed the size of Circular Queue:
```cpp
	this->front = (this->front+1)%this->capacity;
``` 

    Insertion of element in a Queue is refered as Enqueue and the removal of element is refered as Dequeue. 

## **Complexity analysis:**
### **Time Complexity:**
    As there is no loop, and we are only manipulating the pointers therefore,
    Enqueue Operation: O(1), and 
    Dequeue Operation: O(1)

### **Space Complexity:**
    As we need memory space in order to build and store elements in a Queue, therefore for 'n' elements we need extra space of: O(n)
