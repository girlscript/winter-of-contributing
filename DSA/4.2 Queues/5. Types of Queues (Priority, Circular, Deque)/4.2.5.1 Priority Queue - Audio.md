# Priority Queue

## What is Priority Queue?

A priority queue is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority value. And, elements are served on the basis of their priority. That is, higher priority elements are served first. Generally, the value of the element itself is considered for assigning the priority.
For example, The element with the highest value is considered the highest priority element. However, in other cases, we can assume the element with the lowest value as the highest priority element.

## Difference between Priority Queue and Normal Queue

In a queue, the first-in-first-out rule is implemented whereas, in a priority queue, the values are removed on the basis of priority. The element with the highest priority is removed first.

## Implementation of Priority Queue

Priority queue can be implemented using an array, a linked list, a heap data structure, or a binary search tree. Among these data structures, heap data structure provides an efficient implementation of priority queues.
(You can fing proper implementation of Priority Queue in documentation part)
