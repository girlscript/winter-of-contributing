To traverse the 2d matrix in spiral order, we will have to do the following 4 steps. Lets first consider R be the number of rows, and C be the number of columns of 2d array. r = 1, c = 1;

1.   Traverse the rth row and increment r.
2.   Traverse the Cth column and decrement C.
3.   Traverse the Rth row and decrement R.
4.   Traverse the cth column and increment c.

There are few edge cases that we will have to take care of. Refer code for further details.
