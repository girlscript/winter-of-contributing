// Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of ÎŸ(log n). This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer
 // For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in the sorted form.


//Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned.
//If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the middle item.Otherwise,the item is searched
//for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the subarray reduces to zero.

//Here we will see some basic question based on binary search applications.
