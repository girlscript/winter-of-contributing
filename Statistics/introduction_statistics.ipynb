Variable**\n","* The values that are altering according to circumstances are referred to as variables.\n","\n","* A variable can occurs in any form, such as trait, factor or a statement that will constantly be changing according to the changes in the applied environment.\n","\n","* Such variables in statistics are broadly divided into four categories such as independent variables, dependent variables, categorical and continuous variables.\n","* Apart from these, quantitative and qualitative variables hold data as nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. Each type of data has unique attributes.\n","\n","# Types of Variables in Statistics\n","\n","**1. Independent Variables**\n","\n","The independent variable is the one that is computed in research to view the impact of dependent variables. It is also called as resultant variables, predictor or experimental variables.\n","\n","**2. Dependent Variables**\n","\n","The dependent variable is also called a **criterion variable** which is applied in non-experimental circumstances. The dependent variable has relied on the independent variable.\n","\n","**3. Categorical Variables**\n","\n","It is a wide category of variable which is infinite and has no numerical data. These variables are called as **qualitative variables** or **attribute variable** in terms of statistics software.\n","\n","Such variables are further divided into **nominal variables**, **ordinal** and **dichotomous variables**. Nominal variables don’t have any intrinsic order. \n","\n","**4. Continuous Variables**\n","\n","The variables which measure some count or quantity and don’t have any boundaries are are termed as continuous variables. It can be segregated into ratio or interval, or discrete variables.\n","\n","Interval variables have their centralized attribute, which is calibrated along with a range with some numerical values.\n","\n","#**TYPES OF STATISTICS**\n","\n","# **1. Inferential Statistics**\n","\n","* Inferential Statistics makes inference and prediction about population based on a sample of data taken from population. It generalizes a large dataset and applies probabilities to draw a conclusion.\n","\n","*  It is simply used for explaining meaning of descriptive stats. It is simply used to analyze, interpret result, and draw conclusion.\n","\n"," \n","* Inferential Statistics is mainly related to and associated with hypothesis testing whose main target is to reject null hypothesis.\n","\n","\n","\n","# Inferential statistics can be done with help of various steps as given below:\n","\n","1.Obtain and start with a theory.\n","\n","2.Generate a research hypothesis.\n","\n","3.Operationalize or use variables\n","\n","4.Identify or find out population to which we can apply study material.\n","\n","5.Generate or form a null hypothesis for these population.\n","\n","6.Collect and gather a sample of children from population and simply run study.\n","\n","\n","7.Then, perform all tests of statistical to clarify if obtained characteristics of sample are sufficiently different from what would be expected under null hypothesis so that we can be able to find and reject null hypothesis.\n","\n","# **Types of inferential statistics –**\n","Various types of inferential statistics are used widely nowadays and are very easy to interpret. These are given below:\n","\n","* One sample test of difference/One sample hypothesis test\n","* Confidence Interval\n","* Contingency Tables and Chi-Square Statistic\n","* T-test or Anova\n","* Pearson Correlation\n","* Bi-variate Regression\n","* Multi-variate Regression\n","\n","> # **Hypothesis Testing**\n","\n","Hypothesis Testing is a statistical method used to draw inferences about the overall population. It is basically the assumption we make about the population parameter.\n","\n","# Assumptions made are:\n","\n","**Null Hypothesis(H0):** It is the hypothesis to be tested. It suggests a notion that there is no relationship or association between the 2 parameters being studied e.g. Music influences mental health.\n","\n","**Alternate Hypothesis (HA):** All the other ideas contrasting the null hypothesis form the Alternate Hypothesis e.g. Music do not influence mental health.\n","\n","#Errors Associated with the Hypothesis Testing\n","\n","**Type 1 Error:** Denoted by alpha, this error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis even though it’s true.\n","\n","**Type 2 Error:** Denoted by beta, this error occurs when we accept the null hypothesis when it’s actually false.\n","\n","\n","\n","# **12. Descriptive Statistics**\n","\n","* The branch of statistics concerned with quantitatively describing, visually presenting, or summarizing data is called descriptive statistics.\n","* In descriptive statistics, you analyze data using tabular, graphical, and numerical methods.\n","* Using the Descriptive Statistics techniques, you can only make conclusions about the data being analyzed or summarized. \n","* You do not/cannot make any conclusion beyond that data because, in Descriptive Statistics, you do not assume the data being analyzed to be a Sample coming from a larger Population. \n","*In other words, Descriptive Statistics is not Inferential Statistics.\n","\n","![Picture](https://www.k2analytics.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Descriptive_statistics-980x102.png)\n","\n","# **How to Perform Descriptive Statistics?**\n","\n",">There are three methods to perform descriptive statistics. They are **Numerical, Tabular, and Graphical** methods.\n","\n",">Depending on whether you analyze one or more variables simultaneously, the analysis is called **Univariate, Bivariate, or Multivariate**.\n","\n","* **Univariate analysis** – Analysis of only one variable at a time.\n","\n","* **Bivariate and multivariate analysis** – The simultaneous analysis of two or more variables is called bivariate or multivariate analysis.\n","\n","# **1. Numerical Methods**\n","\n","Numerical methods as the name suggest is all about summarizing data by way of numbers. The most common ways of summarizing data using numerical methods are:\n","\n","a) Measures of Central Tendency – Mean, Median, and Mode.\n","\n","b)Measures of Dispersion – Standard Deviation, Variance, Range, and Inter-Quartile Range.\n","\n","\n","#**2.Tabular Methods**\n","\n","* Tabular Methods summarizes the data in table form. \n","\n","* The data is aggregated or summarized at the category level to show the count (frequency) of observations in each category.\n","\n","* Tabular Methods are mostly used for categorical variables. \n","\n","* The tabular reports can be made more informative by having proportions along with the absolute counts.\n","\n","#**3.Graphical Methods**\n","\n","* Graphical Methods are a visual representation of the data.\n","* Visuals are an important tool in the hands of the data scientist to present their analysis of the data. One can use a variety of charts and graphs to represent data. \n","* Some of the important ones are:\n","\n","1. Bar Plot\n","\n","2. Histogram\n","\n","3. Box Plot\n","\n","4. Pie Chart\n","\n","5. Line Plot\n","\n","6. Scatter Plot\n","\n"]}]}
