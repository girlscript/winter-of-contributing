# Android : BroadCast And BroadCast Receivers
## What are Broadcast in Android?

***Broadcasts*** are messages that the Android system and apps send when events occur that might affect the functionality of other apps. For example, 
Android system sends an event when the ***system boots up***, when ***power is connected or disconnected*** or when the ***headphones is connected or disconnected*** etc.

## There are two types of broadcasts:
1. ***System Broadcasts***
2. ***Custom Broadcasts***

***System Broadcasts*** - are the messages that the Android system sends when a system event occurs. These are wrapped in `Intent` objects.

**Examples** :
 - When the device boots, the system broadcasts a system `intent` with the action ```ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED```
 - When the device is disconnected from external power, the system sends intent with the action ```ACTION_POWER_DISCONNECTED```

***Custom Broadcasts*** - are broadcasts that our app sends out. So, we can use these custom broadcasts whenever we want our app to take an action without launching an activity.

**Examples** : 
When we want to let other apps know that the data has been downloaded to the device and is available for them to use.

#### There are 3 ways to deliver custom broadcasts :
1. For normal broadcast, pass the intent to `sendBroadcast()`
2. For ordered broadcast, pass the intent to `sendOrderedBroadcast()`
3. For local broadcast, pass the intent to `LocalBroadcastManager.sendBroadcast()`

## What are Broadcast Receivers? 

Broadcast receivers is an app component that can register for system events or app events. When an event occurs, registered broadcast receivers are notified via an `Intent`.

For example, if you are implementing a media app and you're interested in knowing when the user connects or disconnects the headphones, register for the `ACTION_HEADSET_PLUG` intent action.

**To create broadcast receiver**

1. Define a subclass of the `BroadcastReceiver` class and implement the `onReceive()` method.
2. `Register` the broadcast receiver, either `statically or dynamically`.

#### The above example shows **Manifest declared** Broadcast receivers.


## Now, Let us understand what are **Context Registered Broadcast Receivers**.
`Context registered receivers` receive broadcasts as long as their registering context is valid.

 For example - If you register within an `activity context`, then you can receive broadcasts as long as the activity is not destroyed.

If you registered within the `Application context`, you receive broadcasts as long as the app is running.

You should be mindful to `unregister` the receiver if you no longer need it.
