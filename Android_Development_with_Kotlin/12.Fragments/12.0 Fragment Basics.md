# Fragments 

A Fragment represents a reusable portion of your app's UI. A fragment defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle, and can handle its own input events. Fragments cannot live on their own--they must be hosted by an activity or another fragment. The fragment’s view hierarchy becomes part of, or attaches to, the host’s view hierarchy.

## Modularity

Fragments introduce modularity and reusability into your activity’s UI by allowing you to divide the UI into discrete chunks. Activities are an ideal place to put global elements around your app's user interface, such as a navigation drawer. Conversely, fragments are better suited to define and manage the UI of a single screen or portion of a screen.

Consider an app that responds to various screen sizes. On larger screens, the app should display a static navigation drawer and a list in a grid layout. On smaller screens, the app should display a bottom navigation bar and a list in a linear layout. Managing all of these variations in the activity can be unwieldy. Separating the navigation elements from the content can make this process more manageable. The activity is then responsible for displaying the correct navigation UI while the fragment displays the list with the proper layout.

On the right, a small screen contains a bottom navigation bar that is controlled by the activity and a linear list that is controlled by the fragment.* |

Dividing your UI into fragments makes it easier to modify your activity's appearance at runtime. While your activity is in the `STARTED` lifecycle state or higher, fragments can be added, replaced, or removed. You can keep a record of these changes in a back stack that is managed by the activity, allowing the changes to be reversed.

You can use multiple instances of the same fragment class within the same activity, in multiple activities, or even as a child of another fragment. With this in mind, you should only provide a fragment with the logic necessary to manage its own UI. You should avoid depending on or manipulating one fragment from another.


## Create a fragment

### Setup your environment

Fragments require a dependency on the AndroidX Fragment library. You need to add the Google Maven repository to your project's build.gradle file in order to include this dependency.

```
buildscript {
    ...

    repositories {
        google()
        ...
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        ...
    }
}
```

**To include the AndroidX Fragment library to your project, add the following dependencies in your app's build.gradle file:**

```
dependencies {
    val fragment_version = "1.4.0"

    // Java language implementation
    implementation("androidx.fragment:fragment:$fragment_version")
    // Kotlin
    implementation("androidx.fragment:fragment-ktx:$fragment_version")
}
```

### Create a fragment class

To create a fragment, extend the AndroidX Fragment class, and override its methods to insert your app logic, similar to the way you would create an Activity class. To create a minimal fragment that defines its own layout, provide your fragment's layout resource to the base constructor, as shown in the following example:

```
class ExampleFragment : Fragment(R.layout.example_fragment)
```

The Fragment library also provides more specialized fragment base classes:
1. **DialogFragment:** <br>
Displays a floating dialog. Using this class to create a dialog is a good alternative to using the dialog helper methods in the Activity class, as fragments automatically handle the creation and cleanup of the Dialog. See Displaying dialogs with DialogFragment for more details.
1. **PreferenceFragmentCompat:** <br>
Displays a hierarchy of Preference objects as a list. You can use PreferenceFragmentCompat to create a settings screen for your app.

### Add a fragment to an activity

Generally, your fragment must be embedded within an AndroidX `FragmentActivity` to contribute a portion of UI to that activity's layout. `FragmentActivity` is the base class for `AppCompatActivity`, so if you're already subclassing `AppCompatActivity` to provide backward compatibility in your app, then you do not need to change your activity base class.

You can add your fragment to the activity's view hierarchy either by defining the fragment in your activity's layout file or by defining a fragment container in your activity's layout file and then programmatically adding the fragment from within your activity. In either case, you need to add a `FragmentContainerView` that defines the location where the fragment should be placed within the activity's view hierarchy. It is strongly recommended to always use a `FragmentContainerView` as the container for fragments, as `FragmentContainerView` includes fixes specific to fragments that other view groups such as `FrameLayout` do not provide.

#### Add a fragment via XML

To declaratively add a fragment to your activity layout's XML, use a `FragmentContainerView` element.

Here's an example activity layout containing a single `FragmentContainerView`:

```
<!-- res/layout/example_activity.xml -->
<androidx.fragment.app.FragmentContainerView
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/fragment_container_view"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:name="com.example.ExampleFragment" />
```

The android:name attribute specifies the class name of the Fragment to instantiate. When the activity's layout is inflated, the specified fragment is instantiated, `onInflate()` is called on the newly instantiated fragment, and a `FragmentTransaction` is created to add the fragment to the `FragmentManager`.

_*Note: You can use the class attribute instead of android:name as an alternative way to specify which Fragment to instantiate._


### Add a fragment programmatically

To declaratively add a fragment to your activity layout's XML, use a `FragmentContainerView` element.
Here's an example activity layout containing a single `FragmentContainerView`:

```
<!-- res/layout/example_activity.xml -->
<androidx.fragment.app.FragmentContainerView
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/fragment_container_view"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

Unlike the XML approach, the `android:name` attribute isn't used on the `FragmentContainerView` here, so no specific fragment is automatically instantiated. Instead, a `FragmentTransaction` is used to instantiate a fragment and add it to the activity's layout.

While your activity is running, you can make fragment transactions such as adding, removing, or replacing a fragment. In your `FragmentActivity`, you can get an instance of the `FragmentManager`, which can be used to create a `FragmentTransaction`. Then, you can instantiate your fragment within your activity's onCreate() method using `FragmentTransaction.add()`, passing in the ViewGroup ID of the container in your layout and the fragment class you want to add and then commit the transaction, as shown in the following example:




```
class ExampleActivity : AppCompatActivity(R.layout.example_activity) {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        if (savedInstanceState == null) {
            supportFragmentManager.commit {
                setReorderingAllowed(true)
                add<ExampleFragment>(R.id.fragment_container_view)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

_*Note: You should always use setReorderingAllowed(true) when performing a FragmentTransaction. For more information on reordered transactions, see Fragment transactions._

In the previous example, note that the fragment transaction is only created when `savedInstanceState` is null. This is to ensure that the fragment is added only once, when the activity is first created. When a configuration change occurs and the activity is recreated, `savedInstanceState` is no longer `null`, and the fragment does not need to be added a second time, as the fragment is automatically restored from the `savedInstanceState`.

If your fragment requires some initial data, arguments can be passed to your fragment by providing a `Bundle` in the call to `FragmentTransaction.add()`, as shown below:

```
class ExampleActivity : AppCompatActivity(R.layout.example_activity) {
      override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        if (savedInstanceState == null) {
            val bundle = bundleOf("some_int" to 0)
            supportFragmentManager.commit {
                setReorderingAllowed(true)
                add<ExampleFragment>(R.id.fragment_container_view, args = bundle)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The arguments `Bundle` can then be retrieved from within your fragment by calling `requireArguments()`, and the appropriate `Bundle` getter methods can be used to retrieve each argument.

```
class ExampleFragment : Fragment(R.layout.example_fragment) {
    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        val someInt = requireArguments().getInt("some_int")
        ...
    }
}
```

## Fragment manager

`FragmentManager` is the class responsible for performing actions on your app's fragments, such as adding, removing, or replacing them, and adding them to the back stack.

You might never interact with `FragmentManager` directly if you're using the `Jetpack Navigation library`, as it works with the `FragmentManager` on your behalf. That said, any app using fragments is using `FragmentManager` at some level, so it's important to understand what it is and how it works.

This topic covers how to access the `FragmentManager`, the role of the `FragmentManager` in relation to your activities and fragments, managing the back stack with `FragmentManager`, and providing data and dependencies to your fragments.

### Access the FragmentManager

#### Accessing in an activity

Every `FragmentActivity` and `subclasses` thereof, such as `AppCompatActivity`, have access to the `FragmentManager` through the `getSupportFragmentManager()` method.

#### Accessing in a Fragment

Fragments are also capable of hosting one or more child fragments. Inside a fragment, you can get a reference to the `FragmentManager` that manages the fragment's children through `getChildFragmentManager()`. If you need to access its host `FragmentManager`, you can use `getParentFragmentManager()`.

Let's look at a couple of examples to see the relationships between fragments, their hosts, and the `FragmentManager` instances associated with each.

| ![Relation Between Split View and Swipe View](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67221487/142749805-4be605c6-b583-4e4e-8621-786719f4809d.png) | 
|:--:| 
|*Figure-2: Two UI layout examples showing the relationships between fragments and their host activities.* |

Figure 1 shows two examples, each of which has a single activity host. The host activity in both of these examples displays top-level navigation to the user as a `BottomNavigationView` that is responsible for swapping out the host fragment with different screens in the app, with each screen implemented as a separate fragment.

The host fragment in Example 1, hosts two child fragments that make up a split-view screen. The host fragment in Example 2, hosts a single child fragment that makes up the display fragment of a swipe view.

Given this setup, you can think about each host as having a `FragmentManager` associated with it which manages its child fragments. This is illustrated in the figure 2, along with property mappings between `supportFragmentManager`, `parentFragmentManager` and `childFragmentManager`.

| ![Charts for ubnderstanding Fragment Managger](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67221487/142749808-816667ab-f3ea-4845-b485-083a2a6f374e.png) | 
|:--:| 
|*Figure-3: Each host has its own FragmentManager associated with it that manages its child fragments.* |

The appropriate FragmentManager property to reference depends on where the callsite is in the fragment hierarchy along with which fragment manager you are trying to access.

Once you have a reference to the FragmentManager, you can use it to manipulate the fragments being displayed to the user.

### Child fragments

Generally speaking, your app should consist of a single or small number of activities in your application project, with each activity representing a group of related screens. The activity may provide a point to place top-level navigation and a place to scope `ViewModels` and other view-state between fragments. Each individual destination in your app should be represented by a fragment.

If you want to show multiple fragments at once, such as in a split-view or a dashboard, you should use child fragments that are managed by your destination fragment and its child fragment manager.

Other use cases for child fragments may include the following:

* Screen slides, with a `ViewPager2` in a parent fragment to manage a series of child fragment views.
* Sub-navigation within a set of related screens.
* Jetpack Navigation uses child fragments as individual destinations. An activity hosts a single parent NavHostFragment and fills its space with different child destination fragments as users navigate through your app.

### Using the FragmentManager

The `FragmentManager` manages the fragment back stack. At runtime, the `FragmentManager` can perform back stack operations like adding or removing fragments in response to user interactions. Each set of changes are committed together as a single unit called a `FragmentTransaction`. For a more in-depth discussion about fragment transactions, see the fragment transactions guide.

When the user presses the Back button on their device, or when you call `FragmentManager.popBackStack()`, the top-most fragment transaction is popped off of the stack. In other words, the transaction is reversed. If there are no more fragment transactions on the stack, and if you aren't using child fragments, the back event bubbles up to the activity. If you are using child fragments, see special considerations for child and sibling fragments.

When you call `addToBackStack()` on a transaction, note that the transaction can include any number of operations, such as adding multiple fragments, replacing fragments in multiple containers, and so on. When the back stack is popped, all of these operations are reversed as a single atomic action. If you've committed additional transactions prior to the `popBackStack()` call, and if you did not use `addToBackStack()` for the transaction, these operations are not reversed. Therefore, within a single `FragmentTransaction`, avoid interleaving transactions that affect the back stack with those that do not.

### Perform a transaction

To display a fragment within a layout container, use the `FragmentManager` to create a `FragmentTransaction`. Within the transaction, you can then perform an `add()` or `replace()` operation on the container.

For example, a simple `FragmentTransaction` might look like this:

```
supportFragmentManager.commit {
   replace<ExampleFragment>(R.id.fragment_container)
   setReorderingAllowed(true)
   addToBackStack("name") // name can be null
}
```

In this example, ExampleFragment replaces the fragment, if any, that is currently in the layout container identified by the R.id.fragment_container ID. Providing the fragment's class to the replace() method allows the FragmentManager to handle instantiation using its FragmentFactory. For more information, see Providing dependencies.

setReorderingAllowed(true) optimizes the state changes of the fragments involved in the transaction so that animations and transitions work correctly. For more information on navigating with animations and transitions, see Fragment transactions and Navigate between fragments using animations.

Calling addToBackStack() commits the transaction to the back stack. The user can later reverse the transaction and bring back the previous fragment by pressing the Back button. If you added or removed multiple fragments within a single transaction, all of those operations are undone when the back stack is popped. The optional name provided in the addToBackStack() call gives you the ability to pop back to that specific transaction using popBackStack().

If you don't call addToBackStack() when you perform a transaction that removes a fragment, then the removed fragment is destroyed when the transaction is committed, and the user cannot navigate back to it. If you do call addToBackStack() when removing a fragment, then the fragment is only STOPPED and is later RESUMED when the user navigates back. Note that its view is destroyed in this case. For more information, see Fragment lifecycle.


#### Finding an existing fragment

You can get a reference to the current fragment within a layout container by using findFragmentById(). Use findFragmentById() to look up a fragment either by the given ID when inflated from XML or by the container ID when added in a FragmentTransaction. Here's an example:

```
supportFragmentManager.commit {
   replace<ExampleFragment>(R.id.fragment_container)
   setReorderingAllowed(true)
   addToBackStack(null)
}

...

val fragment: ExampleFragment =
        supportFragmentManager.findFragmentById(R.id.fragment_container) as ExampleFragment
```

Alternatively, you can assign a unique tag to a fragment and get a reference using findFragmentByTag(). You can assign a tag using the android:tag XML attribute on fragments that are defined within your layout, or during an add() or replace() operation within a FragmentTransaction.

```
supportFragmentManager.commit {
   replace<ExampleFragment>(R.id.fragment_container, "tag")
   setReorderingAllowed(true)
   addToBackStack(null)
}

...

val fragment: ExampleFragment =
        supportFragmentManager.findFragmentByTag("tag") as ExampleFragment
```

#### Special considerations for child and sibling fragments

Only one FragmentManager is allowed to control the fragment back stack at any given time. If your app shows multiple sibling fragments on the screen at the same time, or if your app uses child fragments, then one FragmentManager must be designated to handle your app's primary navigation.

To define the primary navigation fragment inside of a fragment transaction, call the setPrimaryNavigationFragment() method on the transaction, passing in the instance of the fragment whose childFragmentManager should have primary control.

Consider the navigation structure as a series of layers, with the activity as the outermost layer, wrapping each layer of child fragments underneath. Each layer must have a single primary navigation fragment. When the Back event occurs, the innermost layer controls navigation behavior. Once the innermost layer has no more fragment transactions from which to pop back, control returns to the next layer out, and this process repeats until you reach the activity.

Note that when two or more fragments are displayed at the same time, only one of them can be the primary navigation fragment. Setting a fragment as the primary navigation fragment removes the designation from the previous fragment. Using the previous example, if you set the detail fragment as the primary navigation fragment, the main fragment's designation is removed.

### Support multiple back stacks

In some cases, your app might need to support multiple back stacks. A common example is if your app uses a bottom navigation bar. FragmentManager allows you to support multiple back stacks with the saveBackStack() and restoreBackStack() methods. These methods allow you to swap between back stacks by saving one back stack and restoring a different one.

saveBackStack() works similarly to calling popBackStack() with the optional name parameter: the specified transaction and all transactions after it on the stack are popped. The difference is that saveBackStack() saves the state of all fragments in the popped transactions.

For example, suppose you previously added a fragment to the back stack by committing a FragmentTransaction using addToBackStack():

```
supportFragmentManager.commit {
  replace<ExampleFragment>(R.id.fragment_container)
  setReorderingAllowed(true)
  addToBackStack("replacement")
}
```
In that case, you can save this fragment transaction and the state of ExampleFragment by calling saveState():

```
supportFragmentManager.saveBackStack("replacement")
```

You can call restoreBackStack() with the same name parameter to restore all of the popped transactions and all of the saved fragment states:

```
supportFragmentManager.restoreBackStack("replacement")
```

### Provide dependencies to your fragments

When adding a fragment, you can instantiate the fragment manually and add it to the `FragmentTransaction`.

```
fragmentManager.commit {
    // Instantiate a new instance before adding
    val myFragment = ExampleFragment()
    add(R.id.fragment_view_container, myFragment)
    setReorderingAllowed(true)
}
```

When you commit the fragment transaction, the instance of the fragment you created is the instance used. However, during a configuration change, your activity and all of its fragments are destroyed and then recreated with the most applicable Android resources. The FragmentManager handles all of this for you. It recreates instances of your fragments, attaches them to the host, and recreates the back stack state.

By default, the FragmentManager uses a FragmentFactory that the framework provides to instantiate a new instance of your fragment. This default factory uses reflection to find and invoke a no-argument constructor for your fragment. This means that you can't use this default factory to provide dependencies to your fragment. It also means that any custom constructor you used to create your fragment the first time is not used during recreation by default.

Suppose you have a DessertsFragment that is responsible for displaying popular desserts in your hometown. Let's assume that DessertsFragment has a dependency on a DessertsRepository class that provides it with the information it needs to display the correct UI to your user.

You might define your DessertsFragment to require a DessertsRepository instance in its constructor.

```
class DessertsFragment(val dessertsRepository: DessertsRepository) : Fragment() {
    ...
}
```

A simple implementation of your FragmentFactory might look similar to the following.

```
class MyFragmentFactory(val repository: DessertsRepository) : FragmentFactory() {
    override fun instantiate(classLoader: ClassLoader, className: String): Fragment =
            when (loadFragmentClass(classLoader, className)) {
                DessertsFragment::class.java -> DessertsFragment(repository)
                else -> super.instantiate(classLoader, className)
            }
}
```


This example subclasses FragmentFactory, overriding the instantiate() method to provide custom fragment creation logic for a DessertsFragment. Other fragment classes are handled by the default behavior of FragmentFactory through super.instantiate().

You can then designate MyFragmentFactory as the factory to use when constructing your app's fragments by setting a property on the FragmentManager. You must set this property prior to your activity's super.onCreate() to ensure that MyFragmentFactory is used when recreating your fragments.

```
class MealActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        supportFragmentManager.fragmentFactory = MyFragmentFactory(DessertsRepository.getInstance())
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    }
}
```

Note that setting the FragmentFactory in the activity overrides fragment creation throughout the activity's fragments hierarchy. In other words, the childFragmentManager of any child fragments you add uses the custom fragment factory set here unless overridden at a lower level.
