Android Kotlin: 12.1 Fragment Lifecycle in Android #5217


## **Definitions:**


### **Fragment** 

In Android, the fragment is the part of Activity which represents a portion of User Interface(UI) on the screen. Each fragment has it’s own lifecycle but due to the connection with the Activity it belongs to, the fragment lifecycle is infulenced by the activity’s lifecycle.



### **Fragment Lifecycle** 

The lifecycle of a fragment represents all the states a fragment undergoes from it's attachment to an activity to it's deattachment from the activity.

## **States/Methods of the Android Fragment Lifecycle :**


### **1)  onAttach** 

The very first method to be called when the fragment has been associated with the activity. This method executes only once during the lifetime of a fragment.  

Below is the example code of onAttach() method.

        
        override fun onAttach(activity: Activity) {
            super.onAttach(activity)
            // add code when fragment instance is attached to activity
        }





###  **2)  onCreate()** 

This method initializes the fragment by adding all the required attributes and components.

Below is the example code of onCreate() method.

              
              override fun onCreate(saveInstanceState: Bundle) {
                    super.onCreate(saveInstanceState)
                    // add your code here which executes when fragment's instance initializes
             }



###  **3) onCreateView()** 

System calls this method to create the user interface of the fragment. The root of the fragment’s layout is returned as the View component by this method to draw the UI.

Below is the example code of onCreateView() method.

              
         override fun onCreateView(inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) : View {
         
              val view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment, container, false)
              // add code here which executes when the views are created
              return view
        }
   
       
    

###  **4)  onViewCreated()** 

System calls this method after the views have been initialised. The data to their corresponding views can be binded in this state.

Below is the example code of onViewCreated() method.

     
              override fun onViewCreated(view: View, saveInstanceState: Bundle) {
                    super.onViewCreated(view, saveInstanceState)
                    // add your code that executes after the creation of layout views
              }

### **5)  onActivityCreated()**	

It indicates that the activity has been created in which the fragment exists. View hierarchy of the fragment also instantiated before this function call. 

Below is the example code of onActivityCreated() method.

        
                override fun onActivityCreated(saveInstanceState: Bundle) {
                      super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState)
                      // add your code that executes after the host activity is created
               }


### **6)  onStart()**

The system invokes this method to make the fragment visible on the user’s device.

Below is the example code of onStart() method.


              override fun onStart() {
                  super.onStart()
                  // add your code here which executes when the Fragment gets visible.
              }
              
              
### **7)  onResume()**

This method is called to make the visible fragment interactive. In simple words, the fragment gets focused to interact with users.

Below is the example code of onResume() method.


              override fun onResume() {
                    super.onResume()
                   // add your code here which executes when the Fragment gets focused and interactable.
              }

### **8)  onPause()**

The counter method of onResume() where the fragment loses it's focus and is uninteractive with the user.

Below is the example code of onPause() method.


               override fun onPause() {
                    super.onPause()
                    // add your code here which executes when the Fragment loses it's focus and is no longer interactive.
                }

              

### **9)  onStop()**

Method to terminate the visibility of fragment from the user’s screen. 

Below is the example code of onStop() method.


               override fun onStop() {
                    super.onStop()
                    // add your code here which executes when the Fragment is no longer visible.
                }

### **10)  onDestroyView()**

System calls this method to clean up all kinds of resources as well as view hierarchy associated with the fragment.

Below is the example code of onDestroyView() method.


                override fun onDestroyView() {
                      super.onDestroyView()
                      // add your code here which executes when the view's and other related resources created in onCreateView() method are removed
                  }

### **11) onDestroy()**

It is called to perform the final clean up of fragment’s state and its lifecycle.

Below is the example code of onDestroy() method.



                  override fun onDestroy() {
                        super.onDestroy()
                     // add your code here which executes when the final clean up for the Fragment's state is needed.
                 }
                 
                 
### **12) onDetach()**

The system executes this method to disassociate the fragment from its host activity.

Below is the example code of onDetach() method.


                  override fun onDetach() {
                        super.onDetach()
                        // add your code here which executes when fragment has been disassociated from its hosting activity
                   }
