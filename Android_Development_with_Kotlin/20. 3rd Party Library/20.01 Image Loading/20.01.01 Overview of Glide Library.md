# **Overview of Glide**

Images play an important role in making the UI of the app more interactive and user-friendly. So, android developers have to take care of using images in the app. They handle the different aspects of the image like slow unresponsive image, loading errors, memory issues. One of the way to load and display images from different sources in the app while taking care of caching and keeping a low memory impact when doing image manipulations is using Glide.

**Glide** is an image loader library for Android, recommended by Google. It provides animated GIF support and handles image loading and caching.

Glide's primary focus is on making scrolling any kind of a list of images as smooth and fast as possible, but Glide is also effective for almost any case where you need to fetch, resize, and display a remote image.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Glide library.

## **Steps to use Glide**

**Step1** : At first, add the dependency in gradle file. Open `app/build.gradle` file in your project and add the following lines of code.

```
dependencies {
   implementation ‘com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.11.0’
   annotationProcessor ‘com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.11.0’
}
```
**Note** : Glide also needs Android Support library v4, so, import support v4 to your project as well.

Sync your gradle once again.

**Step2** : Add InternetPermission inside the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Open the `manifest.xml` file and add the following code
```
<uses-permission android:name=”android.permission.INTERNET”/>
```

**Step3** : Open the layout file for the main Activity and add an imageView to the layout like the following code snippet.
```
ImageView
       android:layout_width=”wrap_content”
       android:layout_height=”wrap_content”
       android:id=”@+id/imageView”
       android:layout_alignParentTop=”true”
       android:layout_centerHorizontal=”true”
 
```

**Step4** : In the `mainActivity` file , add the following code in the `onCreate()` method.

```
ImageView imageView = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.imageView);
       Glide.with(context)
            .load(“YOUR IMAGE URL HERE”)
            .into(imageView)
            .error(R.drawable.imagenotfound);
 ```
 
In the first line, we are getting the ImageView instance from the layout. And then load the image from the above remote URL using Glide library.

With these steps, we are storing the image from the server link into the imageView. Advanced use of Glider is discussed below.

## **Advanced Usage**

### **Resizing the image**
The following code fetches a remote image and resize it before displaying it in an imageView.
```
Glide.with(context)
   .load(“YOUR IMAGE URL HERE”)
   .override(300, 200)
   .error(R.drawable.imagenotfound)
   .into(imageView);
```

### **Placeholder**
It is important to add the fallback in the form of a placeholder image if the application relies on remote assets. The palceholder image is shown immediately and replaced by the remote image when Glide has finished fetching it.
```
Glide.with(context)
   .load(“YOUR IMAGE URL HERE”)
   .placeholder(R.drawable.placeholder)
   .into(imageView);
```

### **Handling Errors**
Just like the placeholder method, there's an error method that accepts a placeholder image. Glide will try to download the remote image three times and displays the error placeholder image if it was unable to fetch the remote asset. THe following code does the said.
```
Glide.with(context)
   .load(“YOUR IMAGE URL HERE”)
   .placeholder(R.drawable.placeholder)
   .error(R.drawable.imagenotfound)
   .into(imageView);
```

### **GIFs support** 
The code for GIFs support is as follows.
```
GlideDrawableImageViewTarget imagePreview = new GlideDrawableImageViewTarget(imageView);

Glide.with(this).load(url).listener(new RequestListener() {  

               @Override  
               public boolean onException(Exception e, String model, Target target, boolean isFirstResource) {                        
                   return false;  
               } 

               @Override  
               public boolean onResourceReady(GlideDrawable resource, String model, Target target, boolean isFromMemoryCache, boolean isFirstResource) {
                   return false;  
               }  
           }).into(imagePreview);
```

## **Adding effects in Image**

### **Blur image**
```
Glide.with(context)
.load(“YOUR IMAGE URL HERE”)
.bitmapTransform(new BlurTransformation(context))
.into(imageView);
```

### **Multiple Transform**
```
Glide.with(context)
.load(“YOUR IMAGE URL HERE”)
.bitmapTransform(new BlurTransformation(context, 25), new CropCircleTransformation(context))
.into(imageView);
```

### **Circle Crop**
```
Glide.with(context)
.load(“YOUR IMAGE URL HERE”)
.bitmapTransform(new CropCircleTransformation(context))
.into(imageView);
```

### **Rounded Corners**
```
int radius = 50;  
int margin = 20;
Glide.with(context)
.load(“YOUR IMAGE URL HERE”)
.bitmapTransform(new RoundedCornersTransformation(context, radius, margin))
.into(imageView);
```
