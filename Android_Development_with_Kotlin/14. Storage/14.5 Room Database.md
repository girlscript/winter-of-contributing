An easy way to use a database in an Android app is with a library called Room. Room is what's called an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library, which as the name implies, maps the tables in a relational database to objects usable in Kotlin code. In this tutorial , you'll learn about 


1.   use of Room library
2.   components of Room Database
3.   implementation of Room

## **Why use Room?**

Room is now considered as a better approach for data persistence than SQLiteDatabase. It makes it easier to work with SQLiteDatabase objects in your app, decreasing the amount of boilerplate code and verifying SQL queries at compile time.

## **Components of Room Database**

Room has three components of Room Database:
1.   Entity
2.   Dao
3.   Database

## **Entity**

Represents a table within the database. Room creates a table for each class that has `@Entity` annotation, the fields in the class correspond to columns in the table. Therefore, the entity classes tend to be small model classes that don’t contain any logic.

### **Entities Annotations**

Here are some useful annotations and their attributes.

**@Entity** : Every model class with this annotation will have a mapping table in database.
*   foreignKeys : names of foreign keys
*   indices : list of indicates on the table
*   primaryKeys: names of entity primary keys
*   tableName

**@PrimaryKey** : As its name indicates, this annotation points the primary key of the entity. If `autoGenerate` set to true, then SQLite will be generating a unique id for the column.
  
`@PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)`

**@ColumnInfo** : Allows specifying custom information about column
```@ColumnInfo(name = “column_name”) ```

**@Ignore** : Field will not be persisted by Room

**@Embeded**: Nested fields can be referenced directly in the SQL queries.

## **Dao**

DAO stands for Data Access Object and is a Kotlin class that provides access to the data. Specifically, the DAO is where you would include functions for reading and manipulating data. Calling a function on the DAO is the equivalent of performing a SQL command on the database. 

## **Database**

Contains the database holder and serves as the main access point for the underlying connection to your app’s persisted, relational data.

To create a database we need to define an abstract class that extends `RoomDatabase`. This class is annotated with `@Database`, lists the entities contained in the database, and the DAOs which access them.

The class that’s annotated with `@Database` should satisfy the following conditions:

*   Be an abstract class that extends `RoomDatabase`.
*   Include the list of entities associated with the database within the annotation.
*   Contain an abstract method that has 0 arguments and returns the class that is annotated with `@Dao`.
*   At runtime, you can acquire an instance of `Database` by calling `Room.databaseBuilder()` or `Room.inMemoryDatabaseBuilder()`.

# **Implementation of Room**

### **Step1** : Add the gradle dependencies


1.   To add it to your project, open the project level `build.gradle` file and add the following code.

```
all projects{
  repositories {
    jcenter()
    maven { url 'https:// maven.google.com' }
  }
}

```
2.   Open the `build.gradle` file for your app or module and add dependencies:

```
implementation "android.arch.persistence.room:runtime:1.0.0"
annotationProcessor "android.arch.persistence.room:compiler:1.0.0"
```

### **Step 2**: Create a Model Class

Room creates a table for each class annotated with `@Entity`; the fields in the class correspond to columns in the table. Therefore, the entity classes tend to be small model classes that don’t contain any logic. Our `Student` class represents the model for the data in the database. So let’s update it to tell Room that it should create a table based on this class:



*   Annotate the class with `@Entity` and use the `tableName` property to set the name of the table.
*   Set the primary key by adding the `@PrimaryKey` annotation to the correct fields — in our case, this is the ID of the User.


*   Set the name of the columns for the class fields using the `@ColumnInfo(name = “column_name”)` annotation. Feel free to skip this step if your fields already have the correct column name.
*   If multiple constructors are suitable, add the `@Ignore` annotation to tell Room which should be used and which not.


```
@Entity(tableName = "student")
public class Student {
  @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)
  private int id;
  @ColumnInfo(name = "name")
  private String name;
  @ColumnInfo(name = "city")
  private String city;

  public Student(int id, String name, String city){
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.city = city;
  }

  @Ignore
  public Student(String name, String city){
    this.name = name;
    this.city = city;
  }
}
```

### **Step 3:** Create Data Access Objects (DAOs)

DAOs are responsible for defining the methods that access the database.

To create a DAO we need to create an interface and annotated with `@Dao`.

```
@Dao

public interface StudentDao {
  @Query(Select * from student)
  List<Student> getStudentList();
  @Insert
  void insertStudent(Student student);
  @Update
  void updateStudent(Student student);
  @Delete
  void deleteStudent(Student student);
}
```
## **Step 4:** Create the database

To create a database we need to define an abstract class that extends `RoomDatabase` . This class is annotated with `@Database`, lists the entities contained in the database, and the DAOs which access them.

```
@Database(entities = Student.class, exportSchema = false, version = 1)
public abstract class StudentDatabase extends RoomDatabase {
  private static final String DB_NAME = "student_db";
  private static StudentDatabase instance;
  public static synchronized StudentDatabase getInstance(Context context){
    if(instance == null){
      instance = Room.databaseBuilder(context.getApplicationContext(), StudentDatabase.class, DB_NAME).fallbackToDestructiveMigration().build();
    }
    return instance;
  }
  public abstract StudentDao studentdao();
}
```

### **Step 5:** Managing Data
To manage the data, first of all, we need to create an instance of the database and then we can insert delete and update the database.

**Query**
```
StudentDatabase appDb = StudentDatabase.getInstance(this);
appDb.studentDao().getStudentList();
```
**Insert**
```
StudentDatabase appDb = StudentDatabase.getInstance(this);
Student student = new Student("Pooja", "Chandigarh");
appDb.studentDao().insertStudent(student);
```
**Delete**
```
StudentDatabase appDb = StudentDatabase.getInstance(this);
appDb.studentDao().deleteStudent(student);
```
**Update**
```
StudentDatabase appDb = StudentDatabase.getInstance(this);
Student student = new Student("Pooja Goyal", Chandigarh);
appDb.studentDao().updateStudent(student);
```

**Note:** Make sure that all the operation should execute on a different thread. It can be done using the below code.
```
AppExecutors.getinstance().diskIO.execute(new Runnable()){
  @Override
  public void run(){
    final List<Student> students = mDb.studentDao().loadAllPersons()
    mAdapter.setTasks(students);
  }
}
```

## **Summary**

We learnt that, 
*   Tables in a SQL database are represented in Room by Kotlin classes called entities.
*   The DAO provides methods corresponding to SQL commands that interact with the database
*   implementation of Room using Kotlin
