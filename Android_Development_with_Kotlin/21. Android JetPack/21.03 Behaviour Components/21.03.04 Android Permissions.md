## Android Permission
* What is an Android Permission ? <br>

Basically you have also observe that, When you first time install any social meadia app or video calling app from any app store and you open it first time, you’ll likely see an app permission request that it want access your device’s camera or mediafiles before you can use videocalling feature or you want to post any picture, and guess what that's an Android Permission. <br>

Android apps are built to perform a set of actions, Most of them require a permissions from users. These starts from reading the information (data) stored in your phone (such as contacts, mediafiles,) to using your camera, microphone, location etc. <br>

App permissions govern what your app is allowed to do and access. Apps cannot automatically grant themselves permissions, these have to be confirmed by the you (user) . Granting permission allows the app to use the features and when you deny them simple then it can't use that features.<br>

Above diagram that shows the high-level workflow for using permissions on Android.

#
<br>

## Types of permissions
There are three types of permissions in Android, They are install-time permissions, runtime permissions, and special permissions. Let's see each permissions one by one , <br>

## Install time permissions: <br>
It gives your app access to restricted data in a limited boundary and also it allow your app to perform some restricted actions that can affect system or other apps in a minimum way. In install-time permissions, when you install an app from playstore the system automatically grants your app the permissions. And you can see install-time permission when you view an app's details page .

</p>
Above picture that shows the list of an app's install-time permissions, which appears in an app store.
<br>
Install time permissions are further divided into two groups: “Normal permissions” and “Signature permissions.”
<br>

* Normal permissions:
These permissions allow access to data and actions that extend beyond your app's sandbox. However, the data and actions present very little risk to the user's privacy, and the operation of other apps. <br>

* Signature permissions:
If the app declares a signature permission that another app has defined, and if the two apps are signed by the same certificate, then the system grants the permission to the first app at install time. Otherwise, that first app cannot be granted the permission.
#
<br>

## Runtime permissions
Runtime permissions give your app some additional access to restricted data, and some time it also allow your app to perform to perform some restricted actions and that can affect your system and other apps, Because of that "Runtime Permissions" is also known as dangerous permissions . <br>

  <img src="https://developer.android.com/images/training/permissions/runtime.svg" width="400px" />
</p>
Above picture that shows, system permission prompt that appears when your app requests a runtime permission. <br><br>

When your app requests this permission, the system presents a runtime permission prompt, as shown in above picture. Some Runtime permissions access private user data, the restricted data that includes location information, microphone , camera and contact information etc. <br>
#
<br>

## Special permissions
The Special app access page in system settings contains a set of user-toggleable operations. Many of these operations are implemented as special permissions. <br>

Special permissions correspond to particular app operations. Only the platform and OEMs can define special permissions. Additionally, the platform and OEMs usually define special permissions when they want to protect access to particularly powerful actions, such as drawing over other apps. <br>
#
<br>


## View and Control Permission in Android 
You can easily check the permissions that you've granted to your installed apps at any time . <br>
Here’s how to access the app permissions list to see all apps and which app using which specific permission: <br>

1. Head into the Android Settings menu. 
2. Find and tap on Apps and Notification.
3. Find and Tap Permission manager or Permission to open the Android permission controller app.
<p align="center">

</p>
<br>


4. Tap on any specific permission you want, from the app permissions list that you’re interested in, like Calendar.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ayush-sleeping/Its-Nothing-don-t-open-it/blob/main/permission-2.jpg" width="300px" />
</p>


5. And now you will see apps that have access to your Calendar . You can also edit access, To remove access, tap on any app . And after that you can remove access to that particular app if you want or just left it.

## Permissions that may Compromise your Privacy
Android defines nine groups of “dangerous” permissions. These permissions contain multiple permissions and if you grant one permissions, In ex. if you allow any app access to camera to take a picture, Here you also allowing it to record a videos. <br>
They are <br>

* Body Sensors <br>
It give access to your health data from paired fitness trackers and any other sensors.

* Calendar <br>
It give access to read, create, edit, or delete your calendar events.

* Camera <br>
It give access from taking photos to recording videos.

* Contacts <br>
It give access the lists of all accounts in your device and to read, create, or edit your contact list.

* Location <br>
It give access from your exact location to cellular data and Wi-Fi for approximate accuracy.

* Microphone <br>
It give access to record audio.

* Phone <br>
It give access to your phone number, current cellular network information, call redirect, ongoing call status.

* SMS <br>
It give access to receive, receive, send MMS and SMS messages. 

* Storage <br>
It give access to all your  phone’s memory (your files, media, photos etc)
#
<br>
<br>

## Which permissions to allow and deny?
There's no any common answer, to which permissions are safe to give access or which are dangerous. We should to use our common sense to identify which app permission is normal, Don't ignore permission before giving access to them, read the permission carefully and try to identify whether it's a reasonable request. <br>

<b> Always identify the requested permissions by app are resonable or not. </b> In ex. You have experience that social media app some time ask for "Location perission", but does it really need this. If we will deny this permissions, might be  some features won’t work without it. In the other hand "Location permission" is must for Google Maps. <br>

After all these things, It's up to you, You have to decide whether you trust your app (To access important information on your device) . You can also deny permissions, its the best way to keep your device safe.

## How to actually ask for Permissions
According to Official Deveoper Android <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xVh-7ywKpE&t=555s">video</a>, that there are four patterns to consider when thinking about permissions: <br>

## How to use Runtime permission in android in kotlin

* You need a Latest version of Android Studio.
* You should already know the Kotlin.
* Basic Android Devlopment skill is must .
* Here, you will learn how to make an app that request a camera permission. We are only only going to implement the permission portion of the app, but not the camera part. 
<br>

#### A. Set up Code

1. Create an  new Android Studio project.
2. Choose Empty Activity.
3. Name the project and set the language to Kotlin.
<br>

4. Add these dependencies into your `build.gradle` and These allow you to use the Activity library.
```
implementation "androidx.activity:activity-ktx:1.2.2"
implementation "androidx.fragment:fragment-ktx:1.3.2"
```
5. Set the `viewBinding` build option.
```
android {
   ...
   buildFeatures {
       viewBinding true
   }
}
```
6. Then press the green hammer button to build. This will generate a binding class called `ActivityMainBinding`.
7. Navigate to the `activity_main.xml` file.
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
   xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
   xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
   android:id="@+id/main_layout"
   android:layout_width="match_parent"
   android:layout_height="match_parent"
   tools:context=".MainActivity">

   <Button
       android:id="@+id/button"
       android:layout_width="wrap_content"
       android:layout_height="wrap_content"
       android:text="Request Permissions"
       android:onClick="onClickRequestPermission"
       app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
       app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
       app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
       app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```
8. Add these strings to the `strings.xml` file.
```
<string name="app_name">Permissions Codelab</string>
<string name="permission_required">Camera access is required to display the camera preview.</string>
<string name="ok">OK</string>
<string name="permission_granted">Permission is granted. You can use the camera now.</string>
```
9. In `MainActivity.kt`, above the `onCreate()` method, define variables for the layout and the `ViewBinding`.
```
private lateinit var layout: View
private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding
```
10. Replace the code in the `onCreate()` method with the code below.
```
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
   super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
   binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
   val view = binding.root
   layout = binding.mainLayout
   setContentView(view)
}
```
11. At the bottom of the file, under the `MainActivity` class add an extension function .
```
fun View.showSnackbar(
   view: View,
   msg: String,
   length: Int,
   actionMessage: CharSequence?,
   action: (View) -> Unit
) {
   val snackbar = Snackbar.make(view, msg, length)
   if (actionMessage != null) {
       snackbar.setAction(actionMessage) {
           action(this)
       }.show()
   } else {
       snackbar.show()
   }
}
```

#### B. Now you have to add Permissions to Manifest

1. Using the `<uses-permission>` tag, To declare that your permission will be used in `Android manifest` .
2. Add the `<uses-feature>` tag to the manifest, Because sometimes the permission you are asking for will also have other requirements. In this case, you cannot use a camera app unless the device has a camera. <br>

In the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, add the permission for camera above the `<application>` tag. <br>

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

#### C.  Create permission launcher
1. In `MainActivity.kt`, create a `val` called `requestPermissionLauncher` and copy this code into it. The next few bullet points will break down what is in here.
```
private val requestPermissionLauncher =
   registerForActivityResult(
       ActivityResultContracts.RequestPermission()
   ) { isGranted: Boolean ->
       if (isGranted) {
           Log.i("Permission: ", "Granted")
       } else {
           Log.i("Permission: ", "Denied")
       }
   }
```
2. Set `requestPermissionLauncher` equal to `registerForActivityResult` and pass in `ActivityResultContracts.RequestPermission()`.
```
private val requestPermissionLauncher =
   registerForActivityResult(
       ActivityResultContracts.RequestPermission())
```
3. Add a callback to handle the case where it is granted or not. In this case we are logging the result.
```
{ isGranted: Boolean ->
       if (isGranted) {
           Log.i("Permission: ", "Granted")
       } else {
           Log.i("Permission: ", "Denied")
       }
}
```


#### D. Request permission
1. Create a function called `onClickRequestPermission(view: View)` and copy this code into it. In the next few bullet points we will break down what is happening inside 
```
fun onClickRequestPermission(view: View) {
   when {
       ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(
           this,
           Manifest.permission.CAMERA
       ) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED -> {
           layout.showSnackbar(
               view,
               getString(R.string.permission_granted),
               Snackbar.LENGTH_INDEFINITE,
               null
           ) {}
       }

       ActivityCompat.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(
           this,
           Manifest.permission.CAMERA
       ) -> {
           layout.showSnackbar(
               view,
               getString(R.string.permission_required),
               Snackbar.LENGTH_INDEFINITE,
               getString(R.string.ok)
           ) {
               requestPermissionLauncher.launch(
                   Manifest.permission.CAMERA
               )
           }
       }

       else -> {
           requestPermissionLauncher.launch(
               Manifest.permission.CAMERA
           )
       }
   }
}
```

2. Set up a `when` statement to cover the three cases: if permission is already granted, if the app deems that they should show the request permission rationale, and if it hasn't been asked yet.
```
when {
   ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(
       this,
       Manifest.permission.CAMERA
   ) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED -> {

   }

   ActivityCompat.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(
       this,
       Manifest.permission.CAMERA
   ) -> {

   }

   else -> {

   }
}
```

3. In the case that the permission is granted, display a snackbar that announces that.
```
ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(
   this,
   Manifest.permission.CAMERA
) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED -> {
   layout.showSnackbar(
       view,
       getString(R.string.permission_granted),
       Snackbar.LENGTH_INDEFINITE,
       null
   ) {}
}
```
<BR>

After all these, Run the app and Finally you will see the output. Congratulations.<br>
