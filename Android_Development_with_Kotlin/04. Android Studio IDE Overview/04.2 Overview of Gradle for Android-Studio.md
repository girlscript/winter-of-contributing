Just like a mechanic uses various tools like screwdrivers, drill tools, hand tools, wrenchers, etc. and these tools help him to work more effectively, faster and in an organized manner, we can use some build tools to develop and test our android apps effectively.

In this tutorial, you'll learn about
  1. build tools
  2. Gradle: A build system ysed in adndroid development
  3. Different gradle files:
  		*   build.gradle (Project Level)
      *   build.gradle (Application Level)



# **What are build tools?**

Build tools are software applications that help in automating a wide variety of tasks that are required by software developers to build the application like:
  *   compiling source code
  *   packaging into binary code
  *   manage required libararies (dependencies)
  *   running automated tesst
  *   deployments
  *   sending notifications, emails, etc.

Some of the common build tools are gradle, apache ant, apache maven, grunt, gulp, etc. Here, we'll learn about gradle.

# **What is Gradle?**

Gradle is an open source build automation tool. In Android Studio, gradle is responsible for code compilation, testing, deployment and conversion of the code into .dex files which are in turn zipped into single .apk fiule on the device and hence running the apps on the device.

As Android Studio comes with Gradle system pre-installed, there is no need to install additional runtime softwares to build our project. Whenever you click on Run button in android studio, a gradle task automatically triggers and starts building the project and after gradle completes its task, app starts running in AVD or in the connected device.

A build system like Gradle is not a compiler or linker, however, it controls and supervises the operation of compilation, linking of files, running test cases, and eventually bundling the code into an apk file for your Android Application.


### **Build Process**

The build process for Android App module follows these steps:
  1. The compiler converts your source code into .dex file (Dalvik   Executable files).
  2. The packager then combines the .dex file and complied resources into an APK (Android Application Package) or AAB (Android App Bundle).
  3. Before the app is installed onto an Android Device or distributed to a store like Play Store, the APK or AAB has to be signed.The packager signs the app using either debug or release keystore.
     *   If you intend to use your app only for testing and profiling, then the packager signs your app with debug keystore.
     *   If you intend to release externally, the packager signs your app with release keystore.

NOTE* The android studio automatically configures new projects with debug keystore.

  4. Before generating the final APK, the packager optimizes your app to use less memory when running on a device.


## **build.gradle Files**

There are two build.gradle files for every android studio project of which, one is for application and other is for project level(module level) build files.

### **build.gradle (Project level)**

The top level (module) build.gradle file is project level build file, which defines build configurations at project level. This file applies configurations to all the modules in android application project. The following code sample describes the default settings.

```bash
buildscript{

    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.2.0")
    }
}
```

The **buildscript block** defines the the Gradle repositories and dependencies that are common to all modules in the project. 

The **repositories block** configures the repositories Gradle uses to search or download the dependencies. The code above defines JCenter and Google as the repository Gradle use to look for its dependencies. You can also use local repostries or define your own repositories.

The **dependencies block** configures the dependencies Gradle needs to use
to build your project. The above code adds Android plugin for Gradle
version 4.2.0 as a classpath dependency.

```bash
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
}
```

The **allprojects block** is where you configure the repositories and dependencies used by all modules in your project, such as third-party plugins or libraries. However, you should configure module-specific dependencies in each module-level build.gradle file. For new projects, Android Studio includes JCenter and Google's Maven repository by default, but it does not configure any dependencies (unless you select a template that requires some).

## **build.graddle (application level)**

The Application level build.gradle file is located in each module of the android project. This file includes your package name as applicationID, version name(apk version), version code, minimum and target sdk for a specific application module. When you are including external libraries then you need to mention it in the app level gradle file to include them in your project as dependencies of the application. The following code shows some default settings.

```bash
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
}
```
The first section in the build configuration applies the Android plugin for Gradle to this build and makes the android block available to specify
Android-specific build options.

```bash
android {

    compileSdkVersion(28)
    buildToolsVersion = "30.0.2"

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId = "com.example.myapp"
        minSdkVersion(15)
        targetSdkVersion(28)
        versionCode = 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }

    buildTypes {
          release {
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

The Android block is where you configure all your android specific build options.
  1. **compileSdkVersion** specifies the Android API level Gradle should use to compile your app. This means your app can use the API features included in this API level and lower.
  2. **buildToolsVersion** specifies the version of the SDK build tools, command-line utilities, and compiler that Gradle should use to build your app. 
  3. The **defaultConfig block** encapsulates default settings and entries for all build variants.
    
			*   applicationId uniquely identifies the package for publishing.
			*   minSdkVersion defines the minimum API level required to run the app.
			*   versionCode defines the version number of your app.
			*   versionName defines a user-friendly version name for your app.

  4. The **buildTypes block** is where you can configure multiple build types By default, the build system defines two build types: debug and release. The debug build type is not explicitly shown in the default build configuration, but it includes debugging tools and is signed with the debug key. The release build type applies Proguard settings and is not signed by default.

```bash
dependencies {
    implementation(project(":lib"))
    implementation("com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0")
    implementation(fileTree(mapOf("dir" to "libs", "include" to listOf("*.jar"))))
}
```
The dependencies block in the module-level build configuration file specifies dependencies required to build only the module itself.

# **Summary**

1. **Gradle** is a build system, which is responsible for code compilation, testing, deployment and conversion of the code into .dex files and hence running the app on the device.
2. There are two build.gradle files for every android studio project of which, one is for application and other is for project level(module level) build files.
  *   **The Top level (module) build.gradle file** is project level build file, which defines build configurations at project level.
  *   **The Application level build.gradle file** is located in each module of the android project.This is used to include project level external libraries in the project.

I hope this helps. Don't forget to give this repository a star.
