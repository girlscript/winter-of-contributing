# :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Resources in Android Studio 

The resources in Android App are some additional files and static content that your files uses in the main code. 
They can be considered as an independet source from which your App
draws its various characteristics.

## :question: But why do we need a separate resource file?
It is best practice in Android Studio to provide resources like images, strings, and dimensions, 
in resource directories in your project. Getting in this habit will prepare you for providing 
alternative resources for specific device configurations and make it easier to add localization options 
to your project later. Not to mention the ease of use you will experience as you make changes
to your app. When you provide them separately, Android uses the appropriate resource 
in all the places where you call a reference to the file. 
When you create a new project, some of these files and directories will be provided 
for you and you will have to create some on your own.

If you are imagining that which folder I am talking about. Look at this image to locate the Resources folder.

It is presented as an abbreviated form ***res***.

# :file_folder: Grouping of Resources

Storing resources in the directory requires each user to follow a pre define format. You need to place certain resources
in a specific sub directory for proper accessibility of those resources.

The hierarchy is here given below
```bash
MyProject/
    src/
        MyActivity.java
    res/
        drawable/
            graphic.png
        layout/
            main.xml
            info.xml
        mipmap/
            icon.png
        values/
            strings.xml
```

If you are wondering what each of these represent, dont worry. I will
walk you through each of them and give you a proper understanding
to make you familiar.

### :white_check_mark: Drawable:
The drawable folder holds all the images that are used by your app.
Any kind of image maybe for the background is stored in this folder.
You have to be careful with what images you store. Be sure to choose images of appropriate size and resolution. 
Images that are too large or having high resolution can cause your app to crash.
Android supports BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, and WebP image formats. 
The drawable folder looks like this <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/Drawable%20folder.PNG"/>
 </p>


In case you do not see the drawable folder in your project, you can easily create it.

Follow these steps and you are good to go.

:pushpin: Right-click the res folder

:pushpin: Choose New

:pushpin: Choose Android Resource Directory

:pushpin: Name the directory **drawable**

:pushpin: In the Available Qualifiers Section add drawable

:pushpin: Click **ok**


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/Android%20resource%20directory.png"/>
 </p>
 
 
 
 <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/creating%20drawable.PNG"/>
 </p>




Your folder will be created and you are now ready to store your images.

Now to call or reference your images from drawable in project XML you have
to use this syntax:
```bash
@drawable/filename
```
For example see this image:


 <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/use%20of%20drawable.PNG"/>
 </p>


Here I have used a image named **black.png** from the drawable folder.
I have set the android background to that image by using this simple line

```bash
android:background = "@drawable/black"
```

### :white_check_mark: Layout
The layout folder holds your XML files that you are using in your
project. The name perfectly suits its role as it is forming the layout
of your whole Android App.

You can see in the image below how a layout folder looks.
It contains your XML files. In this case my app has 2 screens so it has 2 XML
files. 


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/Layout%20folder.PNG"/>
 </p>



When you first start a project you will only see a single XML file 
with name ***activity_main.xml***.


If your layout folder is not visible or any how you deleted it, you
can create it again by following these steps.

:pushpin: Right click on the layout folder

:pushpin: Choose New

:pushpin: Choose Layout Resource File

:pushpin: Name your file

:pushpin: Choose your Root Element

:pushpin: Click ok


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/Layout%20resource%20file.png"/>
 </p>
 
 <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/creating%20layout.PNG"/>
 </p>


You can easily refer to your layout in the resource file using the
syntax
```bash
R.layout.activity_name
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/use%20of%20layout.PNG"/>
 </p>


For example if you see in my example. I am calling my XML File
named as **activity_callback.xml** from the layout folder
```bash
R.layout.activity_callback
```

### :white_check_mark: Mipmap
This folder holds the icon images for your app. Whenever you see an app
one of the first things you notice is the icon. Every app has its unique
icon. These should be only as large as necessary to support 
the devices you want to target for your app.
The mipmap folder looks like this. <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/mipmap%20folder.PNG"/>
 </p>


Some of the common icons you see every day are like below :star: <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/app%20icons.jpg"/>
 </p>


But dont think these icons are made available to us by default in Android.\
The most basic icon available to us is the icon below and some variations of the same. <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/basic%20icon.gif"/>
 </p>


The icons you see of whatsapp , facebook are all made by designers separately.

Again if this folder is absent from your project you can create it following these
steps

:pushpin: Right-click the res folder

:pushpin: Choose New

:pushpin: Choose Android Resource Directory

:pushpin: Name the directory **mipmap**

:pushpin: In the **Resource Types Section** add **mipmap** 

:pushpin: Click ok

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/Android%20resource%20directory.png"/>
 </p>
 
 <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/creating%20mipmap.PNG"/>
 </p>

Any icon you choose to use as mipmap should be named 
***ic_launcher***. Android Studio will use that icon you provided.

### :white_check_mark: Values

The values folder hols various styles and appearances for your app.
it contains the colors, the strings, the themes etc.

The values folder looks like this


 <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/values%20with%20themes.PNG"/>
 </p>


- The colors file holds the **Hex codes** for each color you want to use 
    in your app. You can add new colors by adding a new color element, 
    giving it a name, and adding the desired colorâ€™s hex code.
    Android Studio provides a tiny preview of the color in the margin of the file.

    For adding a new colour
    ```bash
    <color name="New_colour"> Hex Code </color>

    You can refer to any colour resources using this syntax
    ```bash
    @color/colorname
    ```

    This is how the colors.xml file looks in the Android studio
    
    <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/color%20file.PNG"/>
 </p>

   

- The strings file holds all of the text you would like to display to the user.
    
    For adding a new string
    Adding a new string element, giving it a name, 
    and adding the text you would like to display (with no quotes).

    ```bash
    <string name="app_name">My APP</string>
    ```

    #### But why cannot we use the **text** feature in XML and write the text there?

    The reason is that we should avoid hardcoidng strings. If we store a string at one place with
    one common name, we can reuse it everywhere with just referring to the string element.
    Also if we want to update we can update in the resource file rather than changing all the occurences.

    You can use the string resource by referencing by this
    ```bash
    @string/app_name
    ```
    
    <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/string%20use.PNG"/>
 </p>

    This is how the strings.xml file looks in the Android Studio
    
    <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/string%20file.PNG"/>
 </p>
    
   
       


## Some other supported directories in the Resource folder

1. **animator/** - The XML files that defined the property animations used in the app is stored in this. To know more about animations click [twitter](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/prop-animation).
                <p align="center">
                  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/animation%20in%20android.gif"/>
                </p>
2. **anim/** - This stores the XML files that define the tween animations. Tween Animation is defined as an animation which is used to Translate, Rotate, Scale and Alpha any type of view in Android. Even the property animations can be stored in this directory but to clarify things the two different options are provided. Know more about tween animations [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/view-animation#tween-animation).
            <p align="center">
                  <img src="https://github.com/Sakalya100/mlh-init/blob/master/Kotlin/tween%20animation.gif"/>
            </p>
3. **menu/** - it stores all the XML files that defines different Menu's in Android like Main Menu, Option Menu etc.

4. **raw/** - The raw (res/raw) folder is one of the most important folders and it plays a very important role during the development of android projects in android studio. The raw folder in Android is used to keep mp3, mp4, sfb files, etc. We use raw folder to ease the accessibility of assets. We also have an assets directory but to access files in assets we have to use Asset Manager and that is not feasible.

5. **xml/** - Arbitrary XML files that can be read at runtime by calling Resources.getXML() are stored here. Various XML configuration files must be saved here, such as a searchable configuration.

6. **font/** - Arbitrary XML files that can be read at runtime by calling Resources.getXML(). Various XML configuration files must be saved here, such as a searchable configuration. To know more click [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/fonts-in-xml).



## Creating Alias of Resources
 Suppose there is an resource that you want to use for more than one device configuration. But you do not want to create a default resource for that.
 You don't need to put the same resource in more than one alternative resource directory. Instead, you can (in some cases) create an alternative resource that acts as an alias for a resource saved in your default resource directory.

Suppose you have an iccon named icon.png. You want to use this same image for different versions of the app. But
you want to use the same icon in both places as it saves memory because .png files are heavy.
What you can do is 

:round_pushpin: Save this image with any name other than icon.png. For example here we use icon_ca.png.

:round_pushpin: Now we put this file in the default res/drawable directory.

:round_pushpin: Then we create an icon.xml file in in each versions drawable folder.
    for example we have to folders as res/drawable/version1 and res/drawable/version2.
    
:round_pushpin: This icon.xml file refers to the icon_ca.png resource using the <bitmap> element.


> **However you cannot create aliases for all resources. In particular, animation, menu, raw, and other unspecified resources in the xml/ directory don't offer this feature.**

You can read more about aliases from [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources).



## :tada: Quick Revision - Common doubts:
<br>

### What is resources folder?
Resources are the additional files and static content that your code uses, such as bitmaps, layout definitions, user interface strings, animation instructions, and more.

### Where is the Resources folder ?
  
```
WorkspaceName>/temp/<AppName>/res
```

### :thinking: Why is the Android-resources folder important in every Android app ?
Resource folder is the most important folder because it contains all the non-code sources like images, XML layouts, UI strings for our android application.
<br>



### :thinking: Why is the Android-resources folder necessary ?
Resource plays an important role in andriod as it auto check about the configuration required for the device. ... There are different directories used in the Resource folder to make the project best of all. For providing device compatibility one should save in the file in Resource directory for android devices.
