## About Android-Manifest.xml file
You might have think that , How your Android app knows which activity has to be shown first and for that matter what the available activities for your app are, All this things are done in Manifest file. <br> 
The Manifest file provides essential information about your app in the android system, Which system must have before can run any of the application code.<br><br>
Basically when your system starts the app, Manifest file helps to know all the compnents that exists in a app. <br>
In example, Assume that your app requires the internet connection or Camers access,  So in that case it requires the permission and it will ask all that permission when you first starts the app. <br>
The permission mentioned in the manifest file can be either granted or rejected by the users. Once the user grants permission to the app,
the app can use the protected features. If the user denies permission the app doesn’t get permission to access the protected features.

### Manifest <br>
Is the root element of AndroidManifest.xml file. <br> The child element of "manifest" is "application" and it must contain xlmns:android and package attributes. <br>
Ex.

```
<manifest xmlns:android="http://example.ex.com/apk/res/android"
    android:versionCode="%%%version-code-Substitute-here%%%"
    android:versionName="%%%version-name-Substitute-here%%%" 
    package="%%%package-name-Substitute-here%%%">
</manifest>
```

### Information that is stored in the Manifest file:
* Name of the Application's package and file name should be AndroidManifest.xml file.
* Component that includes all Activities, Services, Receivers, and Content Providers .
* Permissions that are required by the application to run the app properly.
* Features by the app, which include both Hardware and Software features. 
* Icon, Version number, Themes, etc. which specified in application metadata.
* Predefined tags are available in Manifest file.
<br>

### Structure of a Manifest file in Android is:
(This how it looks like)
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://android.com/apk/res/android"package="com.example.myapplication">

  <uses-permission />
  <uses-sdk />
  <uses-feature />
  <supports-screens />

  <application>
    <activity>
        <intent-filter>
            <action />
            <category />
        </intent-filter>
    </activity>
  </application>

</manifest>
```

### Why is the Android-Manifest file is important to every Android app ?
The Android manifest file helps to declare the permissions that an app must have to access data from other apps and it defines the whole structure and components of our Android-app.
<br>



### Why is the Android-Manifest file is necessary ?
