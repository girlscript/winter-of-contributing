## What is VCS and why do we need it?

A Version Control System keeps track of the changes that we make to our files. By using a VCS, we can know when the changes were made and who made them. It also lets us easily revert a change if it turned out not to be a good idea. It makes collaboration easier by allowing us to merge changes from lots of different sources. However, unlike a regular file server which only saves the foremost recent version of a file, a VCS keeps track of all the different versions that we create as we save our changes. There are many different version control systems, each with their own implementation and with their own advantages and disadvantages. But, no matter how the VCS is implemented internally, they always access the history of our files.

VCS also let us: 

* Retrieve past versions of the file or directory

* See who changed which files

* How each file was changed and when the file was changed. 

On top of this, we can make edits to multiple files and treat that collection of edits as a single change which is commonly known as a, commit. A VCS even provides a mechanism to allow the author of a commit to record why the change was made, including what bugs, tickets or issues were fixed by the change.

A VCS stores your code and configuration along with its history. A version control system can function a lot like a time machine, giving you insights into the decisions of the past. With a VCS, you can view, track, and select snapshots from the history of your project. So, nothing you do is lost, and since we can use a VCS to store both code and configuration files, we can make the software more scalable and reliable.

## What is Git?

[**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) is a free open-source VCS available for installation on Unix based platforms, Windows and macOS. Git has a distributed architecture; this means that every person contributing to a repository has full copy of the repository on their own development machines.
Collaborators can share and pull in changes that others have made as they need. And because the repositories are all local to the computer being used to create the files, most operations can be done really fast. 

If you want to collaborate with others, it usually makes sense to set up a repository on a server to act as a kind of hub for everyone to interact with. Git can work as a standalone program as a server and as a client. This means that you can use Git on a single machine without even having a network connection. Or you can use it as a server on a machine where you want to host your repository. And then you can use Git as a client to access the repository from another machine or even the same one.

Any of us can create a Git server, and many companies have similar internal services. But if you don't want to set up a Git server yourself and host your repositories, you can use an online service like GitHub. 

[**GitHub**](https://github.com/) is a web-based Git repository hosting service. On top of the version control functionality of Git, GitHub includes extra features like:

* Bug tracking

* Wikis

* Task Management

GitHub lets us share and access repositories on the web and copy or clone them to our local computer, so we can work on them. You donâ€™t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git. You just need to signup and create a GitHub account.

GitHub provides free access to a Git server for public and private repositories. It limits the number of contributors for the free private repositories, and offers an unlimited private repository service for a monthly fee ( this is free for [**Student Developer Packs**](https://education.github.com/pack) )
