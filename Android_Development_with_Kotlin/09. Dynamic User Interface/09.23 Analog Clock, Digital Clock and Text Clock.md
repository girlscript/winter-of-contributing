# Analog Clock, Digital Clock and Text Clock in Android (Kotlin)

**Analog**, **digital** and **Text** clocks are used for display the time in android application.

In Android, AnalogClock is a two handed clock one for hour indicator and the other for minute indicator and DigitalClock & TextClock both looks like your normal digital watch on hand which displays the hours minutes and seconds in digital format.  You can simply use these two widgets in your application but these components cannot be used to change the time so for that you may use TimePicker component.

> **Important Note**: 

- AnalogClock, DigitalClock and TextClock all are only used for displaying time and you cannot change the time. So if you need to change the time you can use Timepicker.

- Digital clock is deprecated in version “ API 17 “ . From API level 17 you can use TextClock instead of digital clock.

**Analog clock** is a subclass of View class. It represents a circular clock. Around the circle, numbers 1 to 12 appear to represent the hour and two hands are used to show instant of the time- shorter one for the hour and longer is for minutes.

**Digital clock / Text Clock** is subclass of TextView Class and uses numbers to display the time in “HH:MM” format.

## Tutorial
<hr>

### Step 1
 Firstly create a new Android Application. This will create an XML file “activity_main.xml” and a Kotlin File “MainActivity.kt".

 ### Step 2
 Open “activity_main.xml” file and add following widgets in a Relative Layout:
- An Analog clock
- A Digital clock
```kotlin
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout
	xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
	xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
	xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
	android:layout_width="match_parent"
	android:layout_height="match_parent"
	tools:context=".MainActivity">


<AnalogClock

	android:layout_marginTop="20dp"
	android:layout_marginLeft="120dp"
	android:layout_width="wrap_content"
	android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
	<DigitalClock

		android:layout_marginLeft="140dp"
		android:textSize="25dp"
		android:layout_marginTop="300dp"
		android:layout_width="wrap_content"
		android:layout_height="wrap_content" />


</RelativeLayout>
```

This will make the UI of the Application. There is no need for assignment of IDs as these widgets will display the time by themselves.

### Step 3
Leave the Kotlin file as it is.

### Step 4
Now Run the app. Both clocks are displayed on the screen as :
