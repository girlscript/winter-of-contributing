## **Introduction-:**

NestedScrollView is just likeÂ ScrollView, but it supports acting as both a nested scrolling parent and child on both new and old versions of Android. It is enabled by default.Â **NestedScrollViewÂ **is used when there is a need for a scrolling view inside another scrolling view. You have seen this in many apps for examplewhen we open a pdf file and when we reached the end of the PDF there is anÂ **AdÂ **below the pdf file. This is whereÂ **NestedScrollView**Â comes in.Â Normally this would be difficult to accomplish since the system would be unable to decide which view to scroll.Â Let'sÂ discuss aÂ NestedScrollView in Android by taking an example.

## **Example**

- **Step 1: Creating a New Project**

To create a new project in Android Studio please refer toÂ How to Create/Start a New Project in Android Studio. Note that choose JavaÂ as language though we are going to implement this project in Java language.

- **Step 2: Before going to the coding section first do some pre-task**

Go to theÂ **app -> res -> values ->Â strings.xml** add two [random_text](http://randomtextgenerator.com/) strings inside theÂ **strings.xml**Â file to display those strings in the **activity_main.xml**Â file.

### XML

```xml
<resources>
	<string name="app_name">GWOC | NestedScrollView </string>
	<string name="random_text_1">
		Hadoop is a data processing tool used to process large size data over distributed
		commodity hardware. The trend of Big Data Hadoop market is on the boom and itâ€™s
		not showing any kind of deceleration in its growth. Today, industries are capable
		of storing all the data generated at their business at an affordable price just
		because of Hadoop. Hadoop helps the industry to know their customerâ€™s behavior,
		customers buying priorities i.e. what they loved the most, and click patterns,
		etc. Hadoop provides personalized recommendations and personalizes ad targeting
		features. Companies are generating thousands of petabytes of data every day so the
		demand for Big Data professionals is very high. Even after a few years,
		Hadoop will be considered as the must-learn skill for the data-scientist
		and Big Data Technology. Companies are investing big in it and it will become
		an in-demand skill in the future. Hadoop provides personalized recommendations
		and personalizes ad targeting

	</string>
	<string name="random_text_2">
		Humans are coming closer to the internet at a very fast rate. It means that the
		volume of data Industries is gathering will increase as time passes because of
		more users. Industryâ€™s are gradually analyzing the need for this useful information
		they are getting from their users. It is for sure that the data always tends to
		an increasing pattern so the companyâ€™s are eventually acquiring professionals
		skilled with Big Data Technologies. According to NASSCOM, Indiaâ€™s Big Data
		Market will reach 16 billion USD by 2025 from 2 billion USD. The growth of smart
		devices in India is growing at a very huge rate that will cause growth in the
		Big Data Market. Since Big Data is growing the demand for Big Data professionals
		will be high. Hadoop provides personalized recommendations and personalizes ad targeting
		features. Companies are generating thousands of petabytes of data every day so the
		demand for Big Data professionals is very high. Even after a few years,

- **Step 3:Designing the UI**

In the activity_main.xml file add the NestedScrollView and inside NestedScrollView add a LinearLayout and inside LinearLayout add two TextView to display the strings which are created inside the strings.xml file and one Button between the TextView. Here is the code for the activity_main.xml file. One can add as many views inside the NestedScrollViewâ€™s LinearLayout

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout
	xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
	xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
	android:layout_width="match_parent"
	android:layout_height="match_parent"
	tools:context=".MainActivity">

	<!-- Nested Scroll view -->
	<androidx.core.widget.NestedScrollView
		android:layout_width="match_parent"
		android:layout_height="wrap_content">

		<!-- Linear layout to contain 2 text view and button -->
		<LinearLayout
			android:layout_width="match_parent"
			android:layout_height="wrap_content"
			android:orientation="vertical">

			<!-- showing random text 1 from strings.xml file -->
			<TextView
				android:layout_width="match_parent"
				android:layout_height="wrap_content"
				android:text="@string/random_text_1" />

			<!-- simple button -->
			<Button
				android:layout_width="match_parent"
				android:layout_height="160dp"
				android:background="@color/colorPrimary"
				android:text="Nested Scroll View "
				android:textColor="#ffffff"
				android:textSize="32dp" />

			<!-- showing random text 2 from strings.xml file -->
			<TextView
				android:layout_width="match_parent"
				android:layout_height="wrap_content"
				android:text="@string/random_text_2" />
			
		</LinearLayout>
		
	</androidx.core.widget.NestedScrollView>

</RelativeLayout>
```


- **Step 4**: Working with MainActivity.java file

There is nothing to do with the MainActivity.java file, so keep it as it is.

```java
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

	@Override
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
		setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
	}
}
```
