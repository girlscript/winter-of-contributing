A user interface element the user can tap or click to perform an action.

It is basically an area on the screen on which if you tap , will perform a certain meaningful action.

## Implementation of Button
* Navigate to your activity_main.xml file
* Add a Constraint Layout or any other layout 
* Set up all the constraints for the buttton. Learn how to do it by clicking on the following link : ([Constraint Layout](https://github.com/girlscript/winter-of-contributing/blob/Android_Development_With_Kotlin/Android_Development_with_Kotlin/07.%20View%20Groups/07.4%20Constraint%20Layout.md) recommended)

```
<Button
        android:id="@+id/button"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_marginStart="159dp"
        android:layout_marginTop="235dp"
        android:layout_marginEnd="159dp"
        android:layout_marginBottom="58dp"
        android:text="Click Me"
        app:elevation="10dp"
        android:background="#000000"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toTopOf="@+id/textView"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />

```

### Now we will discuss about all the button constraints used in the button:

* __android:id__: It is used to set an identity to the element in order to use it on other files. You can set it to anything.
* __android:text__: It is used to set text on the button. Generally it is better to use string resources for this rather than hardcoding text like in this one.
* __android:background__: It is used to set the background colour for the button.
* __app:elevation__: IT is basically used to give an elevated effect to the button by applying a shadow.

I would like you to search about the rest of the parameters.

## Now we will make an app to demonstrate the working of button. Just like this one.

You will have to add a TextView in the layout in your layout(XML) file. This is the code for TextView.
```
<TextView
        android:id="@+id/textView"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Hello World!"
        android:textSize="36sp"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"/>
```
The constraints can be changed in this file. It can be constrained to the button. You will have to figure it out how to do it.

**Navigate to the MainActivity.kt file**
* First we have to take the reference for both the elements i.e Button and TextView.

```
val myButton = findViewById(R.id.button) as Button
val myText = findViewById(R.id.textView) as TextView
```
* After that we will need a variable to keep the track of how many times we have clicked on the button.
`var timesClicked = 0`

* Now to capture the clicks we will use a method known as `setOnClickListener()`. It is basically used to perform a task when a user clicks on the button.
In order to use it add the following code.

```
myButton.setOnClickListener{
            timesClicked += 1
            myText.text = timesClicked.toString()
            Toast.makeText(this@MainActivity,"You clicked me",Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        }
```
Under this method we are basically:
* Incrementing the timesClicked variable to keep track of number of clicks.
* Setting the text of the textView equal to the variable. Text accepts string so we have to convert integer type into string.
* We are also popping a toast , with a text "You clicked me".

#### Now run your app and see the results.
