When building an Android app, it's important that you always test your application on a real device in addition to emulators. This page describes how to set up your development environment and Android-powered device for testing and debugging on the device.

To test an android apps in a real device with Android Studio, You must keep **two** things in mind:

1.	You should enable **USB debugging** option on your android phone.
2.	You must have **driver** installed on your computer.


Now , let me tell you how you can enable USB debugging on your android phone:

*	Go to **Settings** on your Android phone.

*	Scroll down to the bottom and click on **About phone**.

*	On this menu also scroll down to the bottom, you should see something **Build number**.

*	Click on Build number **7** times.

*	Now your Developer Option enables, once you done click on back button and you should see a new option on your android screen i.e. **Developer Options**.

*	Click On Developer Options

*	Scroll down until you see **USB Debugging**

*	Go ahead and click the **check box** next to the USB debugging.

*	Now Hit **Run Button** after selecting Your Project in Project Explorer in Android studio. Choose your device and press OK.

## How to create an android-virtual-device using AVD manager to run your app in Android Studio.

The Android Emulator simulates Android devices on your computer so that you can test your application on a variety of devices and Android API levels without needing to have each physical device.

The emulator provides almost all of the capabilities of a real Android device. You can simulate incoming phone calls and text messages, specify the location of the device, simulate different network speeds, simulate rotation and other hardware sensors, access the Google Play Store, and much more.

#### Requirements and recommendations

The Android Emulator has additional requirements beyond the basic system requirements for Android Studio, which are described below:

*	SDK Tools 26.1.1 or higher

*	64-bit processor

*	Windows: CPU with UG (unrestricted guest) support

*	HAXM 6.2.1 or later (HAXM 7.2.0 or later recommended)

**Steps to install AVD**

*	To open AVD manager, go to top right corner of navigation bar as shown in below image.

![step 1](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1yxQDP-ChSyacZX_z_Oqm_jHNjJjPfRQX)

*	It will open AVD Manager with a list of created virtual devices as shown in below image. It may be empty for you now as you haven't created any device as of now. To create a new device, click on Create Virtual Device button at the bottom-left corner.

*	It will open a window to Select Hardware type for your virtual device. This list contains almost all the Android devices with their respective settings. Select any one out of all the devices listed, with your required configuration (like Size of the screen, Resolution and Density) and click on Next.

![step 2](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ZL2bb5hQ7oAr-KhkWGDUuVVY0L9QwOWJ)

*	Next you will be asked to select System Image that will be the running Android Version for your newly created virtual device. You can choose any Android system images that are already available in your Android Studio, or Download the one you want, by clicking on the Download option available with the names.  Choose as per your required configuration. Click on Next once you are done.

![step 3](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1TXviT2pocImfJqfspt33R78WeluGO3PT)

*	After that Enter the AVD Name in Android Virtual Device and Click on Finish button. Here you can do customization to AVD which you are creating as per your requirement.

![step 4](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1i37PTwOetdL0uejNLfFDASl4qL_gqC5q)

*	Now again open AVD manager and you will see your newely created AVD (Android Virtual Device) is added in the list.

*	After that your AVD will start in Emulator. Now you can run your App in this AVD.
