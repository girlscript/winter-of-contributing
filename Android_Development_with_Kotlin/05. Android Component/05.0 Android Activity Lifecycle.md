## Activity

* Activity is the part of application with which the user interacts.

* Activity represents a single screen with user interface.

* It serves as an entry point for an app's interaction with the user.
</br>
</br>

## Activity LifeCycle

* The activity lifecycle is the set of states an activity can be in during its lifetime.

* During the interaction with users the activities go through diffrent states.

* All these stages of  stages of the activity lifecycle the activity class provides a core set of 6 callbacks.

* onCreate()

* onStart()

* onResume()

* onPause()

* onStop()

* onDestroy()

## Why we should learn about activity lifecycle

Activity is the most important part of any android application as all the UI elements are contained in it. So if we want to learn android development then it is must to learn about activity lifestyle.

</br>


## Activity Lifecycle Callbacks
</br>

Activity Lifecycle Callbacks are the functions that are called before or after the transition.

The above image shows us the flow of stages when there is a transition between diffrent activities.

</br>
</br>


### OnCreate()

* When the activity is created  the OnCreate() function is called to initialised the activity.

* Every time there is transition between the activities OnCreate() funcion is called.

* In OnCreate() funtion you can perform tasks like setting up User Interface , assigning class scope variables , basic app startup logic and setting up background task etc.

</br>
</br>

Syntax of OnCreate()
```
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        Toast.makeText(this,"OnCreate is called",Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
    }
```
</br>
</br>

 ### OnStart()

 * After the activity is inititalized the system calls onStart() function and the activity enters the starting state.

 * During this method the activity is not yet rendered on the screen but is about to become visible to the users.

 * In this method we can perform operations related to UI components.

 </br>
</br>

Syntax of OnStart()
 ```
      ovrride fun OnStart(){
          super.OnStart()
          Toast.makeText(this," OnStart is called",Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
      }

 ```
</br>
</br>

 ### OnResume()

 * In this method the activity finally gets redered on the screen.

 * The activity is in the active state.

 * The users can interact with the activity in this state.

</br>
</br>

Syntax of OnResume()
  ```
      ovrride fun OnResume(){
          super.OnStart()
          Toast.makeText(this," OnResume is called",Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
      }

 ```
</br>
</br>

 ### OnPause()

 * In this method the activity pauses and the previous activity resumes.

 * The activity does not recive user input and is unable to execute code.

 * This is done when the users presses back or home button.

</br>
</br>

Syntax of OnPause()
  ```
      ovrride fun OnPause(){
          super.OnPause()
          Toast.makeText(this," OnPause is called",Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
      }

 ```
</br>
</br>

 ### OnStop()
 
 * When this method is called the activity is no longer visible to the users.

 * In this state either the activity is getting destroyed or another activity comes back to resume state.
</br>
</br>

Syntax of OnStop()
  ```
      ovrride fun OnStop(){
          super.OnStop()
          Toast.makeText(this," OnStop is called",Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
      }

 ```
 </br>
</br>

 ### OnRestart()

 * In this method the activity is being restarted i.e when the activity is returning to the foreground.

 * The activity which is in stopped state is about to start.

 * When the activity restarts is starts working from where it paused.

</br>
</br>

Syntax of OnRestart()
  ```
      ovrride fun OnRestart(){
          super.OnRestart()
          Toast.makeText(this," OnRestart is called",Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
      }

 ```

 </br>
</br>

 ### OnDestroyed()

 * When OnDestroyed function is called the activity is destroyed because either activity is finished or because the system is reclaiming the memory of the activity used.

 * It is the final callback method that an activity recives.
</br>
</br>

Syntax of OnDestroy()
  ```
      ovrride fun OnDestroy(){
          super.OnDestroy()
          Toast.makeText(this," OnDestroy is called",Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
      }

 ```
