## Overview
A <b> Task </b> is a collection of activities that users interact with when trying to do something in your app. These activities are arranged in a stack—the <b> Back stack </b>—in the order in which each activity is opened. <br>
<br>
<b> For example </b>, an email app might have one activity to show a list of new messages. When the user selects a message, a new activity opens to view that message. This new activity is added to the back stack. Then, if the user presses or gestures Back, that new activity is finished and popped off the stack. <br>

##

Also, the <b> Back Stack </b> is also applies to `fragments`, With the use of `addToBackStack()` , you can add the `FragmentTransaction` to the back stack, whenever you are providing a `fragment transaction` to add, replace , remove a fragment from your UI.  <br>

This <b> Figure </b> is the representation of how each new activity in a task adds an item to the back stack. When the user presses or gestures Back, the current activity is destroyed and the previous activity resumes. <br>
We also have experienced that, if we continues to press Back, then each activity in the stack is popped off to reveal the previous one, until the user returns to the Home screen. The task no longer exists, when all activities are removed from the stack.
<br>
<br>

## Behaviors of Task and Back stack
The application launcher creates a new Task with the main Activity created and placed in the root of the back stack.
Basically whenever the activity that we are working on currently starts anyother Activity, then new Activity is shown on top of the stack . Now the previous activity moves below the current activity and is Stopped.  <br>
And when we pressed the Back Button the current Activity is destroys in the back stack and the previous Activity will continue from there.

<br>
<br>

To summarize the default behavior for activities and tasks:
<br>

* When Activity A starts Activity B, Activity A is stopped, but the system retains its state (such as scroll position and text entered into forms). If the user presses the Back button while in Activity B, Activity A resumes with its state restored. 
* When the user leaves a task by pressing the Home button, the current activity is stopped and its task goes into the background. The system retains the state of every activity in the task. If the user later resumes the task by selecting the launcher icon that began the task, the task comes to the foreground and resumes the activity at the top of the stack.
* If the user presses the Back button, the current activity is popped from the stack and destroyed. The previous activity in the stack is resumed. When an activity is destroyed, the system does not retain the activity's state.
* Activities can be instantiated multiple times, even from other tasks.
<br>
<br>

##  Few Important properties of Tasks
* When Task is selected from the recent screens or when the Launcher icon is pressed , The task is brought to the foreground.
* When a new task is created or when the home button is pressed , The Task Goes to the background.
* The memory is cleared in All Activities , When the user Leaves the task for a long time or when he/she leaves mutiple Task in The Background, exept the root Activity for the system to recover the memory.
<br>
<br>

## Background and foreground Tasks
[ Source of this picture: <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack?authuser=3">Android Developer</a> ]
<p align="center">

</p>
This <b> Figure </b> shows, Two tasks: Task B receives user interaction in the foreground, while Task A is in the background, waiting to be resumed. <br>
<br>

A task is a cohesive unit that can move to the background when a user begins a new task or goes to the Home screen. While in the background, all the activities in the task are stopped, but the back stack for the task remains intact—the task has simply lost focus while another task takes place, as shown in figure 2. A task can then return to the foreground so users can pick up where they left off. <br>
<br>

<b> Note: </b> Multiple tasks can be held in the background at once. However, if the user is running many background tasks at the same time, the system might begin destroying background activities in order to recover memory, causing the activity states to be lost.
<br>
<br>

## Multiple activity instances
[ Source of this picture: <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack?authuser=3">Android Developer</a> ]
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://developer.android.com/images/fundamentals/diagram_multiple_instances.png?authuser=3" width="300px" />
</p>

This <b> Figure </b> shows,  A single activity is instantiated multiple times. <br>
<br>

Because the activities in the back stack are never rearranged, if your app allows users to start a particular activity from more than one activity, a new instance of that activity is created and pushed onto the stack (rather than bringing any previous instance of the activity to the top). As such, one activity in your app might be instantiated multiple times (even from different tasks), as shown in figure 3. If the user navigates backward using the Back button or gesture, each instance of the activity is revealed in the order they were opened (each with their own UI state). However, you can modify this behavior if you do not want an activity to be instantiated more than once.
<br>
<br>


## Saving Activity State 
As discussed above, the system's default behavior preserves the state of an activity when it is stopped. This way, when users navigate back to a previous activity, its user interface appears the way they left it. However, you can—and should—proactively retain the state of your activities using callback methods, in case the activity is destroyed and must be recreated.
<br>

* When the system stops one of your activities (such as when a new activity starts or the task moves to the background), the system might destroy that activity completely if it needs to recover system memory. 
* When this happens, information about the activity state is lost. If this happens, the system still knows that the activity has a place in the back stack, but when the activity is brought to the top of the stack the system must recreate it (rather than resume it).
* In order to avoid losing the user's work, you should proactively retain it by implementing the `onSaveInstanceState()` callback methods in your activity.
<br>
<br>

## Manage tasks
The way Android manages tasks and the back stack, as described above—by placing all activities started in succession in the same task and in a last in, first out stack—works great for most apps and you shouldn't have to worry about how your activities are associated with tasks or how they exist in the back stack. However, you might decide that you want to interrupt the normal behavior. Perhaps you want an activity in your app to begin a new task when it is started (instead of being placed within the current task); or, when you start an activity, you want to bring forward an existing instance of it (instead of creating a new instance on top of the back stack); or, you want your back stack to be cleared of all activities except for the root activity when the user leaves the task. <br>
<br>
You can do these things and more, with attributes in the ` <activity>` manifest element and with flags in the intent that you pass to `startActivity()`. <br>
In this regard, these are the principal `<activity>` attributes that you can use: 
<br>

* `taskAffinity`
* `launchMode`
* `allowTaskReparenting`
* `clearTaskOnLaunch`
* `alwaysRetainTaskState`
* `finishOnTaskLaunch`
<br>

And these are the principal intent flags that you can use:
<br>

* `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`
* `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP`
* `FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP`
