## About Content Provider
```Content providers``` provide the content or data to Android applications from an Android system or any other Android applications on request. Such requests are handled by the methods of the ```ContentResolver class```. <br> <br>
You get a ContentResolver by calling ```getContentResolver()``` from within the implementation of an Activity or other application component: 
```
ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();
```
<br>

A content provider can use different ways to store its data and the data can be stored in a database, in files, or even over a network. They handle the manages access to the "central repository". <br> We can perform multiple operations like insert, update, delete and edit on the data stored in content provider using ```insert()```, ```update()```, ```delete()``` and ```query()``` methods. <br> <br>

* A content provider coordinates access to the data storage layer in your application for a number of different APIs and components, As shown in given figur- (It represent the relationship between "Content provider" and other "components".)

## Accessing the data from Content Provider <br>
Whenever you want to access data in content provider, There we need to use ContentResolver object to communicate with the provider as a client in our application. <br>
A common pattern for accessing a ContentProvider from your UI uses a CursorLoader to run an asynchronous query in the background. In our application, UI components will call CursorLoader to query and get a the needed information from ContentProvider with the help of ContentResolver.

<p align="center">

</p>

> **Refercence of this picture:- https://developer.android.com/**

We use the ```contentResolver().query()``` method, So that we can get the data provided by the Content Provider.
Following is the code for the same:
```
// Queries the user dictionary and returns results

cursor = contentResolver.query(
        UserDictionary.anyword.CONTENT_URI, // content URI of the words table
        projection,                         // columns to return for each row
        selectionClause,                    // Selection criteria
        selectionArgs.toTypedArray(),       // Selection criteria
        sortOrder                           // sort order for returned rows
)
```

<br>
<br>

## Querying a Content Provider
  * To query a content provider you have to follow three steps which are given below:
     * The URI that identifies the provider
     * The names of the data fields you want to receive
     * The data types for those fields
<br>
<br>

## Content URIs
A content provider that controls multiple data sets (multiple tables) exposes a separate URI for each one. All URIs for providers begin with the string ```content://```. <br>
Format of URI in android applications -
```
content://authority/path
``` 

Content URIs example:- In the preceding lines of code, the constant CONTENT_URI contains the content URI of the user dictionary's "words" table. 
```
content://user_dictionary/words
```

Let's see each part role of an URI: <br>
<br>
   content:-   It's used to represent given URI is a content URI.<br>
   authority:-  It represents the name of content provider. <br>
   path:-  It represents the table’s path. <br>
<br>


## CRUD operations
Full Form of CRUD Operations is <br>
C – Create  <br>
R – Read    <br>
U – Update  <br>
D – Delete  <br>
<br> 
The above are the four operations of content providers : <br>

* Create: It's used for creation of data in content providers.
* Read: It reads data stored in the content provider.
* Update: It lets the editing in data in content providers.
* Delete: It deletes data stored in its Storage.
<br>
<br>

## Understand with Example
Let's just suppose that, We have a Android operating system and as we know in that each app having its own data and now assume one situation where app "A" wants to connect with the app "B"  database , But that's not possible because the database that is being maintained by app "B" is private to that particular app, The only mechanism is the app "A" need to request the data from the app "B" and app"B" will respond back with the data. <br>
<br>
Now comes the "Content Provider" role, Basically content provider make sure that app"B" share its data in a secure manner. And here comes "Content Resolver" role, The app"A" will use an API called as Content Resolver , using which it will hit app"B" database or data. Content provider that is defined in the app"B" will respond back using a format called as "Cursor" , and as you can see that it is a Inter process communication . <br>
<br>

Some example of Android Content Providers:

* The Gallery that contains your photos or images.
* Contact lists that contain Contact details.
* A dictionary that has collections of all the words that are used.
* The music playlist has a list of your Favourite songs.
<br>
<br>

## where we use Content Provider

* You want to offer complex data or files to other applications.
* You want to expose your application data to widget.
* You want to implement custom search suggestion in your application
* You want to copy and paste a complex data or file from your application to other application. <br>
and so many other ways are there.

<br>
<br>

## Creating a content provider

## To build a provider follow these steps: <br>
1. Design the raw data storage for your data. And a content provider offers data in two types, They are "File data" and "Structured data" .
2. Now, define a implemenatation of ContentProvider class and its required methods. 
3. Define the provider's authority string, its content URIs, and column names, intent actions, extras data flags and also define the permissions that you will require for applications that want to access your data.
4. You add other optional pieces, such as  implementation of AbstractThreadedSyncAdapter that can synchronize data between the provider and cloud-based data
<br>
<br>

## After building a provider, Next steps is Designing data storage: <br>
Basically content provider is the interface to data saved , Before you create interface you must decide how to store the data in a structured format. we can store data any form as we wish, and after that we have to design interface to read and write the data as necessary.  <br>
Some of the data storage technologies that are available in Android are SQLite(relational database), LevelDB(non-relational database), If you want store unstructured data( audio, image, or video) then you can store the data as files.
<br>
<br>

## Designing content URIs:
A content URI is a URI that identifies data in a provider. Content URIs include the symbolic name of the entire provider (its authority) and a name that points to a table or file (a path). The optional id part points to an individual row in a table. Every data access method of ```ContentProvider``` has a content URI as an argument; this allows you to determine the table, row, or file to access. <br>
<br>

* Designing an authority:-
 For example, if your Android package name is com.example.<appname>, you should give your provider the authority com.example.<appname>.provider.
<br>

* Designing a path structure:-
 For example, if you have two tables table1 and table2, you combine the authority from the previous example to yield the content URIs com.example.<appname>.provider/table1 and com.example.<appname>.provider/table2.
<br>

* Content URI patterns:-
To help you choose which action to take for an incoming content URI, the provider API includes the convenience class ```UriMatcher```, which maps content URI "patterns" to integer values. You can use the integer values in a ```switch``` statement that chooses the desired action for the content URI or URIs that match a particular pattern. <br>
<br>

A content URI pattern matches content URIs using wildcard characters: <br>

* ```*```: Matches a string of any valid characters of any length.
* ```#```: Matches a string of numeric characters of any length.
<br>

As an example of designing and coding content URI handling, consider a provider with the authority ```com.example.app.provider``` that recognizes the following content URIs pointing to tables: <br>

* ```content://com.example.app.provider/table1```: A table called ```table1```.
* ```content://com.example.app.provider/table2/dataset1```: A table called ```dataset1```.
* ```content://com.example.app.provider/table2/dataset2```: A table called ```dataset2```.
* ```content://com.example.app.provider/table3```: A table called ```table3```.
<br>

The provider also recognizes these content URIs if they have a row ID appended to them, as for example ```content://com.example.app.provider/table3/1``` for the row identified by ```1``` in ```table3```. <br>
<br>
The following content URI patterns would be possible: <br>
<br>

```content://com.example.app.provider/*```
Matches any content URI in the provider. <br>
```content://com.example.app.provider/table2/*```: <br>

Matches a content URI for the tables ```dataset1``` and ```dataset2```, but doesn't match content URIs for ```table1``` or ```table3```. <br>

```content://com.example.app.provider/table3/#```: Matches a content URI for single rows in ```table3```, such as ```content://com.example.app.provider/table3/6``` for the row identified by ```6```. <br>
<br>

The following code snippet shows how the methods in ```UriMatcher``` work. This code handles URIs for an entire table differently from URIs for a single row, by using the content URI pattern ```content://<authority>/<path>``` for tables, and ```content://<authority>/<path>/<id>``` for single rows.

The method ```addURI()``` maps an authority and path to an integer value. The method ```match()``` returns the integer value for a URI. A ```switch``` statement chooses between querying the entire table, and querying for a single record: <br>
<br>

```
private val sUriMatcher = UriMatcher(UriMatcher.NO_MATCH).apply {
    /*
     * The calls to addURI() go here, for all of the content URI patterns that the provider
     * should recognize. For this snippet, only the calls for table 3 are shown.
     */

    /*
     * Sets the integer value for multiple rows in table 3 to 1. Notice that no wildcard is used
     * in the path
     */
    addURI("com.example.app.provider", "table3", 1)

    /*
     * Sets the code for a single row to 2. In this case, the "#" wildcard is
     * used. "content://com.example.app.provider/table3/3" matches, but
     * "content://com.example.app.provider/table3 doesn't.
     */
    addURI("com.example.app.provider", "table3/#", 2)
}
...
class ExampleProvider : ContentProvider() {
    ...
    // Implements ContentProvider.query()
    override fun query(
            uri: Uri?,
            projection: Array<out String>?,
            selection: String?,
            selectionArgs: Array<out String>?,
            sortOrder: String?
    ): Cursor? {
        var localSortOrder: String = sortOrder ?: ""
        var localSelection: String = selection ?: ""
        when (sUriMatcher.match(uri)) {
            1 -> { // If the incoming URI was for all of table3
                if (localSortOrder.isEmpty()) {
                    localSortOrder = "_ID ASC"
                }
            }
            2 -> {  // If the incoming URI was for a single row
                /*
                 * Because this URI was for a single row, the _ID value part is
                 * present. Get the last path segment from the URI; this is the _ID value.
                 * Then, append the value to the WHERE clause for the query
                 */
                localSelection += "_ID ${uri?.lastPathSegment}"
            }
            else -> { // If the URI is not recognized
                // You should do some error handling here.
            }
        }

        // call the code to actually do the query
    }
}
```

## Implementing the ContentProvider class:

<p align="center">
  <img src=https://www.tutlane.com/images/android/android_content_provider_with_required_methods.png width="200px"/>
</p>

> **Refercence of this picture:- https://www.tutlane.com/**

The abstract class ContentProvider defines six abstract methods that you must implement as part of your own concrete subclass.

1. ```query()```:- It receives a request from a client and Then result is returned as a Cursor object .
2. ```insert()```:- It inserts new data in content provider.
3. ```update()```:- It updates an existing record from content provider.
4. ```delete()```:- It deletes an existing record from content provider.
5. ```getType()```:- It returns "MIME" type of data in content provider. and last one,
6. ```onCreate()```:- It initialize the provider.
<br>

All of these methods except ```onCreate()``` are called by a client application that is attempting to access your content provider.

<br>
<br>


## Implementing MIME Types in Content-Provider:

"Content Provider" class has two methods for returning MIME types:

1. ```getType()```:- One of the required methods that you must implement for any provider.
2. ```getStreamTypes()```:- A method that you're expected to implement if your provider offers files.
<br>

* MIME types for tables:
The ```getType()``` method returns a String in MIME format that describes the type of data returned by the content URI argument. <br>

For example, if a provider's authority is ```com.example.app.provider```, and it exposes a table named ```table1```, the MIME type for multiple rows in ```table1``` is:
```
vnd.android.cursor.dir/vnd.com.example.provider.table1
```
For a single row of ```table1```, the MIME type is:
```
vnd.android.cursor.item/vnd.com.example.provider.table1
```
<br>

* MIME types for files: 
If your provider offers files, implement ```getStreamTypes()```. The method returns a String array of MIME types for the files your provider can return for a given content URI. 
<br>

For example, consider a provider that offers photo images as files in ```.jpg```, ```.png```, and ```.gif``` format. If an application calls ```ContentResolver.getStreamTypes()``` with the filter string ```image/*``` (something that is an "image"), then the ```ContentProvider.getStreamTypes()``` method should return the array: <br>
<br>

``` { "image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/gif"} ```
<br>

If the app is only interested in .jpg files, then it can call ```ContentResolver.getStreamTypes()``` with the filter string ```*\/jpeg```, and ```ContentProvider.getStreamTypes()``` should return: <br>


```{"image/jpeg"}``` <br>

If your provider doesn't offer any of the MIME types requested in the filter string, getStreamTypes() should return null.
<br>
<br>

## Content Provider Permissions:
A provider's application can specify permissions that other applications must have in order to access the provider's data.
These permissions ensure that the user knows what data an application will try to access. Based on the provider's requirements, 
other applications request the permissions they need in order to access the provider. 
End users see the requested permissions when they install the application. <br>
<br>
To get the permissions needed to access a provider, an application requests them with a <uses-permission> element in its manifest file. <br>

The following <uses-permission> element requests read access to the User Dictionary Provider: <br>
```<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_USER_DICTIONARY_examples">```
<br>
<br>

## Intents and data access:
Applications can access a content provider indirectly with an ```Intent```. The application does not call any of the methods of ```ContentResolver``` or ```ContentProvider```. Instead, it sends an intent that starts an activity, which is often part of the provider's own application. The destination activity is in charge of retrieving and displaying the data in its UI. Depending on the action in the intent, the destination activity may also prompt the user to make modifications to the provider's data.
