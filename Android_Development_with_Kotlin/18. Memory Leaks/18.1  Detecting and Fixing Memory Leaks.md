# Memory Leaks in Android

- A memory leak is basically a failure of releasing unused objects from the memory.
- Memory leaks occur when an application allocates memory for an object, but then fails to release the memory when the object is no longer being used. Over time, leaked memory accumulates and results in poor app performance and even crashes.
- Memory allocation, memory deallocation, and garbage collection are the automatic processes that the **garbage collector** does by itself, but the situation becomes difficult for the garbage collector when the user is referencing the object, which is in not use anymore, but since that object is being referenced by another object, garbage collector feels that the unused object is being used by another object and due to this garbage collector does not free-up the memory of that object, due to which available heap memory get decreases leading to memory shortage and memory leak.

> *Why should we fix Memory Leaks?*

> No one wants to use an app which is slow, laggy, eats up a lot of memory or crashes after a few minutes of use. It can create a really bad experience for the user and if it continues for long, then there is a huge possibility that you will lose that user forever.

## How to detect these Memory Leaks?

**LeakCanary** library makes it super easy for anyone to detect leaks in their apps.
 It runs along with your app, dumps memory when needed, looks for potential memory leaks and gives you a notification with a clean and useful stack trace to find the root cause of the leak.

 ## Some common Memory Leak scenarios and how to fix them :

 - **Unregistered Listeners**

    Suppose you want to receive location updates in your app then all you need to do is get the LocationManager system service and register a listener for location updates.

    ```kotlin
    private fun registerLocationUpdates() {
        mManager = getSystemService(LOCATION_SERVICE) as LocationManager
        mManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, TimeUnit.MINUTES.toMillis(1), 100, this)
    }
    ```
    You have implemented the listener interface in your Activity itself and thus the LocationManager keeps a reference to it. Now when its time for your Activity to die, the Android framework will call onDestroy() on it but the garbage collector will not be able to remove the instance from memory because the LocationManager is still holding a strong reference to it.

    The solution is very simple. Just unregister the listener in onDestroy() method and you are good to go.

    ```kotlin
    fun onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy()
        if (mManager != null) {
            mManager.removeUpdates(this)
        }
    }
    ```

- **Inner Classes**

    ```kotlin
    class BadActivity : Activity() {
        private var mMessageView: TextView? = null
        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
            setContentView(R.layout.layout_bad_activity)
            mMessageView = findViewById<View>(R.id.messageView) as TextView
            LongRunningTask().execute()
        }

        private inner class LongRunningTask :
            AsyncTask<Void?, Void?, String>() {
            protected override fun doInBackground(vararg params: Void): String {
                return "Am finally done!"
            }

            override fun onPostExecute(result: String) {
                mMessageView!!.text = result
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    The problem with inner classes here is that the non-static inner class holds an implicit reference to the outer enclosing class (that is, the Activity itself). 
    Now if we rotate the screen or if this long running task lives longer than the lifetime of the Activity, then it will not let the garbage collector collect the entire Activity instance from memory. *A simple mistake leading to a huge memory leak.*

    ```kotlin
    class GoodActivity : Activity() {
        private var mLongRunningTask: AsyncTask<*, *, *>? = null
        private var mMessageView: TextView? = null
        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
            setContentView(R.layout.layout_good_activity)
            mMessageView = findViewById<View>(R.id.messageView) as TextView
            mLongRunningTask = LongRunningTask(mMessageView).execute()
        }

        override fun onDestroy() {
            super.onDestroy()
            mLongRunningTask!!.cancel(true)
        }

        private class LongRunningTask(messageView: TextView?) :
            AsyncTask<Void?, Void?, String?>() {
            private val messageViewReference: WeakReference<TextView>
            @Override
            protected fun doInBackground(vararg params: Void): String? {
                var message: String? = null
                if (!isCancelled) {
                    message = "I am finally done!"
                }
                return message
            }

            override fun onPostExecute(result: String?) {
                val view: TextView = messageViewReference.get()
                if (view != null) {
                    view.text = result
                }
            }

            init {
                messageViewReference = WeakReference(messageView)
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    To overcome with this problem, we have transformed the non-static inner class to a static inner class as static inner classes don’t hold any implicit reference to its enclosing outer class. But now we can’t access the non-static variables (like the TextView) of the outer class from a static context so we have to pass our required objects references to the inner class through its constructor.

- **Bitmaps**

    Bitmaps objects are generally quite heavy and if dealt improperly can lead to significant memory leaks
    The bitmap memory related to image resources that you use in your app are all automatically managed by the framework itself but if you are dealing with bitmaps manually, be sure to recycle() them after use.

- **Anonymous Classes**

    These anonymous classes have been the most common reason for memory leaks.
    Anonymous classes are nothing but non-static inner classes which can cause potential memory leaks 

    ```kotlin
    class MoviesActivity : Activity() {
        private var mNoOfMoviesThisWeek: TextView? = null
        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
            setContentView(R.layout.layout_movies_activity)
            mNoOfMoviesThisWeek = findViewById<View>(R.id.no_of_movies_text_view) as TextView
            val repository: MoviesRepository = (application as MoviesApp).getRepository()
            repository.getMoviesThisWeek()
                .enqueue(object : Callback<List<Movie?>?>() {
                    fun onResponse(
                        call: Call<List<Movie?>?>?,
                        response: Response<List<Movie?>?>,
                    ) {
                        val numberOfMovies: Int = response.body().size()
                        mNoOfMoviesThisWeek!!.text = "No of movies this week: $numberOfMovies"
                    }

                    fun onFailure(call: Call<List<Movie?>?>?, t: Throwable?) {
                        // Oops.
                    }
                })
        }
    }
    ```

    Here, we are using a very popular library **Retrofit** for making a network call and displaying the result in a TextView. It is quite evident that the Callable object keeps a reference to the enclosing Activity class.
    
    Now if this network call runs on a very slow connection and before the call ends, the Activity is rotated or destroyed somehow, then the entire Activity instance will be leaked.

    It is always advisable to use static inner classes instead of anonymous classes whenever possible or necessary.
