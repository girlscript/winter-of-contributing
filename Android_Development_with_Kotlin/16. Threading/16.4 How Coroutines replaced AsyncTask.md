# How Coroutines replaced AsyncTask?

AysncTask has been one of the most widely used solution for background operations. AsyncTask is an API in Android’s framework that makes it easy(ish) to run operations in the background and return values when finished. And that makes sense. AsyncTask was intended to enable proper and easy use of the UI thread. However, the most common use case was for integrating into UI, and that would cause Context leaks, missed callbacks, or crashes on configuration changes. It also has inconsistent behavior on different versions of the platform, swallows exceptions from doInBackground.

For a very long time in Android, if you needed to do anything asynchronously when making an app, you’d probably be using AsyncTask. Unlike Kotlin’s Coroutines, AsyncTask has been around for a while, and it’s built right in.

All in all, Android community has mix opinions about AsyncTask. But there is a big news from google, AsyncTask is deprecated in Android API level 30.

Now all android developers must do this extra work of changing all AsyncTask with some other background operation tool. This will impact existing smooth functionality and will require additional testing efforts.

So, in this blog I will provide solution by which you will be able to migrate all your AsyncTask easily with minimal changes. I have created a class which will replace your own AsyncTask implementation.
Before that some basics about Kotlin Coroutines.

## What is Coroutines?

1. Light-weight thread.

    Coroutines can run in parallel, wait for each other and communicate. We can create thousands of them, and pay very little in terms of performance. True threads, on the other hand, are expensive to start and keep around. A thousand threads can be a serious challenge for a modern machine.

2. Asynchronous code in synchronous style

    Coroutines allow running an asynchronous piece of code in the same manner as you’d normally run a synchronous one. It removes complicated syntax and boilerplate code.

## Why to use Coroutines?

In Android app, UI freezes when we try to process heavy and time consuming operation like database operation, bitmap conversions etc. on main thread.

So we need some tool which allow us to perform our task in background i.e asynchronously.
Popular Asynchronous tools:

* RxJava — needs lot of learning curve
* AsyncTask — memory leak issues
* Threads — Complicated to handle
* Callbacks — Unreadable and adds a ton of code

## Coroutines Builders

* As suspending function cannot be invoked from a regular function so Kotlin has provided us Coroutines builders, which allow calling a suspending function from a regular non-suspending scope. The Kotlin Coroutine library provides several coroutine builders:

1. launch

    Usually, the point of coroutines is not to block the thread, but rather start an asynchronous task. The coroutine builder called launch allows to start a coroutine in background and keep working in the meantime. A Job represents a coroutine and exists in the CoroutineContext.

2. async

    Conceptually, async is just like launch. It creates a coroutine and returns its future result as an             implementation of Deferred<T>
    * await(): You can use .await() on a deferred value to get its desired result.
    * cancel(): Deferred is also a Job, so you can cancel it if needed like jobs.

3. runBlocking

## CoroutineDispatcher

CoroutineDispatcher is an abstract class that is responsible for launching your coroutine. There are 4 dispatcher can use to launch your coroutine.

1. Default: This launches your coroutine by using a common pool of threads.
1. Main: This dispatchers confines itself to the Main thread and hence using one thread.
1. IO: This provides a shared pool of 64 on demand created threads to your coroutines.
1. Unconfined: Special purpose dispatchers which is not to be used for coding.
These are just fundamentals that you should know before start using Coroutines in your project.


## Adding Coroutines Support

Before you can start using coroutines, you need to actually add them to your project.

### Adding Kotlin Support

If you already have Kotlin implemented, skip ahead to the next section. Otherwise, you’ll need to add Kotlin support to your project. Check out my tutorial on adding Kotlin to an existing project for more details.

### Adding Coroutine Libraries

In your module-level build.gradle, include the following dependencies.

```
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.5.0'
    implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android:1.5.0'
}
```
Sync your project, and Kotlin’s coroutines will now be available to use.

## Using Coroutines

### Implementing a CoroutineScope

In order to use coroutines, you’ll need to have a CoroutineScope instance available. An easy way to do this is to just implement it in your containing class.

For example, to implement a CoroutineScope in an Activity:

```
class SomeActivity : AppCompatActivity, CoroutineScope by MainScope() {
        ...

        override fun onDestroy() {
            super.onDestroy()
     
           cancel()
        }
}
```

This will make SomeActivity implement the CoroutineScope interface by way of the MainScope class. MainScope will handle all implementation logic for CoroutineScope, while allowing you to use the CoroutineScope methods. Calling cancel() in onDestroy() makes sure that no asynchronous logic continues to run after the Activity exits.

### Replacing AsyncTask with Coroutines

Say you have an AsyncTask inside an Activity that performs a long-running operation in the background and eventually returns a String. Something like the following.

```
private inner class SomeTask : AsyncTask<Void, Void, String>() {
    override fun doInBackground(vararg params: Void): String {
        try {
            //Pretend this is an actual operation that takes 10 seconds and not just sleeping.
            Thread.sleep(10000);
        } catch (e: InterruptedException) {}
         
        return "SomeString";
    }

    override fun onPostExecute(result: String) {
        val someTextView = findViewById(R.id.some_text_view)
        someTextView.text = result
    }
}
```

Replacing this with a coroutine is easy. Just use the async() method. Kotlin’s async() runs on whichever Thread it was launched on, but does it asynchronously. This means you can update Views and such without having to worry about using the right Thread.

```
class SomeActivity : AppCompatActivity(), CoroutineScope by MainScope() {
    ...

    private fun doOperation() {
        async {
            //Inside coroutine scopes (like inside async here), delay is used instead of Thread.sleep.
            delay(10000)

            val someTextView = findViewById(R.id.some_text_view)
            someTextView.text = "SomeString"
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, using coroutines can be a lot simpler than using AsyncTask. You don’t have to just call async() and let it do its thing, though. You can hold a reference to it and even wait for it to finish.

```
val asyncJob = async {
    //Some operation
}
//Pause here until the async block is finished.
asyncJob.await()

//This won't run until asyncJob finishes, but other operations started before the job, or started from another method, can still run.
doSomethingElse()
```

### Returning values with async

You can even return a value from async() if you want. So the original example could become something like this.

```
class SomeActivity : AppCompatActivity(), CoroutineScope by MainScope() {
    ...
    private fun doOperation() {
        val asyncJob = async {
            //Inside coroutine scopes (like inside async here), delay is used instead of Thread.sleep.
            delay(10000)

            //Whatever the type is of the last line is what async() eventually returns.
           "SomeString"
        }

        val result = asyncJob.await()

        val someTextView = findViewById(R.id.some_text_view)
        someTextView.text = result
    }
}
```

### Using withContext
For convenience, Kotlin provides withContext(). This inlines the whole await() thing and just returns the value to you.

```
class SomeActivity : AppCompatActivity(), CoroutineScope by MainScope() {
    ...
    private fun doOperation() {
        //Run asynchronously on the main Thread.
        val result = withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
            delay(10000)

            "SomeResult"
        }

        val someTextView = findViewById(R.id.some_text_view)
        someTextView.text = result
    }
}
```
