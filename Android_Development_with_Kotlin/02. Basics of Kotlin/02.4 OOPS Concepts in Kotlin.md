# What is OOP?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while in object-oriented style of programming, you can divide a complex problem into smaller sets by creating objects that contain both data and methods.

Features of Object-oriented programming are:

* OOP is faster and easier to execute
* OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
* OOP helps to keep the Kotlin code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug

# Defining Class and Creating Objects

### Kotlin Class

Class is a blueprint for the objects which have common properties. Kotlin classes are declared using keyword class. Kotlin class has a class header which specifies its type parameters, constructor etc. and the class body which is surrounded by curly braces.

#### Syntax of Kotlin class declaration
```kotlin=
class className{ // class header
  // property
  // member function
}
```

Properties and member function of class are accessed by **.** operator using object
#### Example
Create a **Car** class along with some properties (brand, model and year)
```kotlin
class Car {
  var brand = ""
  var model = ""
  var year = 0
  private var isOn: Boolean = false
  fun turnOn() {    // member function
      isOn = true
  } 
  fun turnOff() {    // member function
      isOn = false
  }
}
```
### Kotlin Object
Object is real time entity or may be a logical entity which has state and behavior. It has the characteristics:

* **state**: it represents value of an object.
* **behavior**: it represent the functionality of an object.

Object is used to access the properties and member function of a class. Kotlin allows to create multiple object of a class.

### Create an Object
Now we can use the class named **Car** to create objects.

In the example below, we create an object of Car called c1 , and then we access the properties of c1 by using the dot syntax (.), just like we did to access array and string properties:

#### Example
```kotlin
// Create a c1 object of the Car class
val c1 = Car()

// Access the properties and add some values to it
c1.brand = "Ford"
c1.model = "Mustang"
c1.year = 1969

println(c1.brand)   // Outputs Ford
println(c1.model)   // Outputs Mustang
println(c1.year)    // Outputs 1969
```

# Constructor

A constructor is a special member function that is invoked when an object of the class is created primarily to initialize variables or properties. A class needs to have a constructor and if we do not declare a constructor, then the compiler generates a default constructor.
 Kotlin has  **two**  types of constructors –


1. **Primary Constructor**
2. **Secondary Constructor**


A class in Kotlin can have at most one primary constructor, and one or more secondary constructors. The primary constructor initializes the class, while the secondary constructor is used to initialize the class and introduce some extra logic.


### **Primary Constructor –**

The primary constructor is initialized in the class header, goes after the class name, using the  **constructor**  keyword. The parameters are optional in the primary constructor.


```kotlin
class Add constructor(val a: Int, val b: Int) {
     // code
}
```
The constructor keyword can be omitted if there is no annotations or access modifiers specified. 

```kotlin
class Add(val a: Int, val b: Int) {
     // code
}
```

**Kotlin program of primary constructor –**


```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>)
{
    val add = Add(5, 6)
    println("The Sum of numbers 5 and 6 is: ${add.c}")
}
//primary constructor
class Add constructor(a: Int,b:Int)
{
    var c = a+b;
}
```
**Output:**

> The Sum of two numbers is: 11

**Explanation:**
 When we create the object add for the class then the values 5 and 6 passes to the constructor. The constructor parameters a and b initialize with the parameters 5 and 6 respectively.
 The local variable c contains the sum of variables. In the main, we access the property of constructor using  **${add.c}**.


**Primary Constructor with Initializer Block –**

The primary constructor cannot contain any code, the initialization code can be placed in a separate initializer block prefixed with the  **init**  keyword.
**Kotlin program of primary constructor with initializer block –**

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val emp = employee(1406, "Saksham")
}
class employee(emp_id : Int , emp_name: String) {
    val id: Int
    var name: String
 
    // initializer block
    init {
        id = emp_id
        name = emp_name
 
        println("Employee id is: $id")
        println("Employee name: $name")
    }
}

```

**Output:**

```
Employee id is: 1406
Employee name: Saksham
```

**Explanation:**
 When the object  **emp**  is created for the class employee, the values 1406 and "Saksham" passed to the parameters  **emp_id**  and  **emp_name**  of the constructor. Two properties are declared in the class id and name.
 Initializer block is executed at the time of object creation,and not only initialize the properties but also prints to the standard output.


**Default value in primary constructor –**

Similar to functions default values in functions, we can initialize the constructor parameters with some default values.

**Kotlin program of default values in primary constructor-**


```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val emp = employee(1406, "Saksham")
    val emp2 = employee(1408)// default value for emp_name will be used here
    val emp3 = employee()// default values for both parameters because no arguments passed
 
}
class employee(emp_id : Int = 100 , emp_name: String = "abc") {
    val id: Int
    var name: String
 
    // initializer block
    init {
        id = emp_id
        name = emp_name
 
        print("Employee id is: $id, ")
        println("Employee name: $name")
        println()
    }
}

```
**Output:**


```
Employee id is: 1406, Employee name: Saksham
Employee id is: 1408, Employee name: abc
Employee id is: 100, Employee name: abc
```

**Explanation:**
 Here, we have initialized the constructor parameters with some default values emp_id = 100 and emp_name = "abc";.
 When the object  **emp**  is created we passed the values for both the parameters so it prints those values.
 But, at the time of object  **emp2**  creation, we have not passed the emp\_name so initializer block uses the default values and print to the standard output.


### **Secondary Constructor –**

As mentioned above, Kotlin may have one or more secondary constructors. Secondary constructors allow initialization of variables and allow to provide some logic to the class as well. They are prefixed with the  **constructor**  keyword.

**Kotlin program of implementing secondary constructor-**

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>)
{
    Add(5, 6)
}
//class with one secondary constructor
class Add
{
    constructor(a: Int, b:Int)
    {
        var c = a + b
        println("The sum of numbers 5 and 6 is: ${c}")
    }
}

```
**Output:**

> The sum of numbers 5 and 6 is: 11

**Calling one secondary constructor from another –**

A secondary constructor may call another secondary constructor of the same class using **this()** function. In the below program, we have called the another constructor using **this(a,b,7)** because invoking of that constructor require three parameters.

**Kotlin program of calling one constructor from another-**


```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>)
{
    Add(5,6)
}
class Add {
    // calling another secondary using this
    constructor(a: Int,b:Int) : this(a,b,7) {
        var sumOfTwo = a + b
        println("The sum of two numbers 5 and 6 is: $sumOfTwo")
    }
    // this executes first
    constructor(a: Int, b: Int,c: Int) {
        var sumOfThree = a + b + c
        println("The sum of three numbers 5,6 and 7 is: $sumOfThree")
    }
}

```

**Output:**


```
The sum of three numbers 5,6 and 7 is: 18
The sum of two numbers 5 and 6 is: 11
```

**Calling parent class secondary constructor from child class secondary constructor –**

We can call the secondary constructor of parent class from the child class using the  **super**  keyword. In the below program, we have shown the process of calling.

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    Child(1406, "Ashrut",55555.00)
}
open class Parent {
    var id: Int 
    var name: String 
    constructor (emp_id: Int, emp_name: String) {
        id = emp_id
        name = emp_name
    }
}
class Child : Parent {
    var salary : Double
    constructor (emp_id : Int, emp_name: String,emp_salary: Double):super(emp_id,emp_name){
        salary= emp_salary
        println("Employee id is: $id")
        println("Employee name: $name")
        println("Employee salary: $salary")
    }
}
```

# Inheritance

Inheritance is an important feature of object oriented programming language. Inheritance allows to inherit the feature of existing class (or base or parent class) to new class (or derived class or child class). The subclass contains features of superclass as well as its own.

The concept of inheritance is allowed when two or more classes have same properties. It allows code reusability. A derived class has only one base class but may have multiple interfaces whereas a base class may have one or more derived classes.



All classes in Kotlin are  **by default**  final. It means these  **classes are not inheritable**. To make a class inheritable, we add open keyword in the class header.

A child class inherits a parent class using : operator. The  **syntax to inherit a class**  is:

```kotlin
open class Parent{
    // Parent class features
}
class Child : Parent(){
    // Child class features
}
```

**Primary constructor in Inheritance**

If the parent class has a primary constructor then the  **child class must call the primary constructor of parent class**.


Vehicle class has properties:

- is the vehicle for carrying passengers
- no. of tyres
- fuel capacity of vehicle


```kotlin
open class Vehicle(carryPassenger: Boolean, tyres: Int, fuelCapacity: Int){
    init {
        println("Does Vehicle carry passenger: $carryPassenger")
        println("Tyres in Vehicle: $tyres")
        println("Fuel capacity of Vehicle: $fuelCapacity")
    }
}

// child class with extra airBags property
class Car(carryPassenger: Boolean, tyres: Int, fuelCapacity: Int, airBags: Int) : Vehicle(carryPassenger, tyres, fuelCapacity){
    // init function for child class
    init {
        println("No. of air bags in car: $airBags")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val car = Car(true, 4, 50, 4)
}

```

```
Does Vehicle carry passenger: true
Tyres in Vehicle: 4
Fuel capacity of Vehicle: 50
No. of air bags in car: 4
```


While creating the object of Car class, the primary constructor(default) of the child class which is Car is called which internally calls  **the primary constructor of parent class**  Vehicle first and then  **its init block**. After that, the primary default constructor of the child class Car completes and then the init  **block of child class**  Car is executed.

**Secondary constructor in Inheritance**

If the base class does not have a primary constructor but has a secondary constructor then the derived class should call the secondry constructor of the base class using the super keyword.

```kotlin
open class Vehicle{
    // secondary constructor
    constructor(carryPassenger: Boolean, tyres: Int, fuelCapacity: Int){
        println("Does Vehicle carry passenger: $carryPassenger")
        println("Tyres in Vehicle: $tyres")
        println("Fuel capacity of Vehicle: $fuelCapacity")
    }
}
// child class
class Truck: Vehicle{
    // secondary constructor calling super for parent class
    constructor(carryPassenger: Boolean, tyres: Int, fuelCapacity: Int, loadCarryCapacity: Int): super(carryPassenger, tyres, fuelCapacity){
        println("Load carrying capacity is: $loadCarryCapacity")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val truck = Truck(false, 10, 200, 1000)
}
```

```
Does Vehicle carry passenger: false
Tyres in Vehicle: 10
Fuel capacity of Vehicle: 200
Load carrying capacity is: 1000
```

# Function Overriding

In inheritance, we can provide specific implementation of the base class functions inside the derived class. It means if a function exists in parent class then we can  **provide a different implementation**  of the  **same function in child class**. It is known as  **Function Overriding**.

In Kotlin, the functions are also final  **by default**. To override a function, it must be marked as open(just like the class) in the parent class and in the child class we must use the keyword override instead of open to specify that we have overridden the function.

The  **function name and parameters should be same**.

And, the  **return type of child class functions**  can be a  **sub type**  of the parent class functions.

Let us see an example in which we will override two methods of the base class:
```kotlin
// parent class
open class Vehicle{

    open fun run(){
        println("Vehicle is running")
    }

    open fun drivenBy(name: String){
        println("Vehicle is driven by: $name")
    }
}
// child class
class Jeep: Vehicle(){

    override fun run() {
        println("Driving a Jeep")
    }

    override fun drivenBy(name: String) {
        println("Jeep is driven by $name")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val jeep = Jeep()
    jeep.run()
    jeep.drivenBy("Ninja")
}
```

```
Driving a Jeep

Jeep is driven by Ninja
```


We can also call parent class functions inside child class using super keyword.

**Kotlin Overriding Properties**

Similarly, we can also override properties and  **change their value inside child class**. The properties should be marked open in order to override them and use the override keyword in the child class when we override the property just like we did for class functions.

```kotlin
package inheritance

// parent class
open class Vehicle{
    open val color: String = "Black"
    open fun printColor(){
        println("The color of vehicle is: $color")
    }
}
// child class
class Jeep: Vehicle(){
    override val color: String = "Red"
    override fun printColor(){
        println("The color of Jeep is: $color")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val jeep = Jeep()
    jeep.printColor()
}
```

# Visibility Modifiers

Visibility modifiers are keywords that set the visibility (accessibility) of classes, objects, interface, constructors, functions, properties and their setters. (You cannot set visibility modifier of getters as they always take the same visibility as that of the property.)

## Visibility Modifiers Inside Package

A package organizes a set of related functions, properties and classes, objects, and interfaces.

| **Modifier** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **public** | declarations are visible everywhere |
| **private** | visible inside the file containing the declaration |
| **internal** | visible inside the same module (a set of Kotlin files compiled together) |
| **protected** | not available for packages (used for subclasses) |

Let's take an example:

```kotlin
// file name: hello.kt

package temp

fun funct1() {} // public by default and visible everywhere

private fun func2() {} // visible inside hello.kt

internal fun func3() {} // visible inside the same module

var mssg = "Yo"; // visible everywhere

get() = field // visible inside hello.kt (same as its property)

private set(value) { // visible inside hello.kt
    field = value
}

private class class1 {} // visible inside hello.kt
```

**Visibility Modifiers Inside Classes and Interfaces**

Here&#39;s how visibility modifiers works for members (functions, properties) declared inside a class:

| Modifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| public | visible to any client who can see the declaring class |
| private | visible inside the class only |
| protected | visible inside the class and its subclasses |
| internal | visible to any client inside the module that can see the declaring class |

**Note:**  If you override a protected member in the derived class without specifying its visibility, its visibility will also be protected.

```kotlin
open class Base() {
    private var a = 1 // public by default
    var b = 2 // private to Base class
    protected open val c = 3 // visible to the Base and the Derived class
    internal val d = 4 // visible inside the same module
    protected fun e() { } // visible to the Base and the Derived class
}

class Derived: Base() {
    // b, c, d, and e() of the Base class are visible
    // a is not visible
    override val c = 7 // c is protected
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val base = Base() // base.b and base.d are visible
    // base.a, base.c and base.e() are not visible
    val derived = Derived()
    // derived.c is not visible
}
```
---
# Abstract Class

In Kotlin, abstract class is declared using the  **abstract**  keyword in front of class. An abstract class can not instantiated means we can not create object for the abstract class.

**Abstract class declaration:**

```kotlin
abstract class className {
    .........
}
```

**Points to remember:**

1. We can't create an object for abstract class.
2. All the variables (properties) and member functions of an abstract class are by default _non-abstract_. So, if we want to override these members in the child class then we need to use  **open**  keyword.
3. If we declare a member function as abstract then we does not need to annotate with  **open**  keyword because these are open by default.
4. An abstract member function doesn't have a body, and it must be implemented in the derived class.

An abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract members as shown below:

```kotlin
abstract class className(val x: String) {   // Non-Abstract Property       
    abstract var y: Int      // Abstract Property

    abstract fun method1()   // Abstract Methods

    fun method2() {          // Non-Abstract Method
        println("Non abstract function")
    }
}
```

Examples:
```kotlin
abstract class Employee(name: String) {

    init {
        println("My name is $name.")
    }

    fun displaySalary(salary: Int) {
        println("Salary is $salary.")
    }

    abstract fun displayJob(description: String)
}

class Manager(name: String): Employee(name) {
    override fun displayJob(description: String) {
        println(description)
    }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    //val emp=Employee("James Cooper")  cannot create object of abstract class
    val manager = Manager("James Cooper")
    manager.displayJob("I'm a manager.")
    manager.displaySalary(23123)
}

```

# Interface

An interface is a blueprint of class.Kotlin interface is similar to Java 8. It contains abstract method declarations as well as implementation of method.Interface may have property but it needs to be abstract or has to provide accessor implementations.

**How to define an interface?**

Keyword interface is used to define interfaces in Kotlin. For example,

```kotlin
interface MyInterface {
    var myVar: String   // abstract property
    fun absMethod()          // abstract method
    fun hello() = "Hello there" // method with default implementation
}
```
#### Example:  

```kotlin

interface MyInterface  {
   var myVar: Int            // abstract property
   fun absMethod():String    // abstract method 
   fun hello() {
      println("Hello there")
   }
}
class InterfaceImp : MyInterface {
   override var myVar: Int = 25
   override fun absMethod() = "Keep Learning"
}
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
   val obj = InterfaceImp()
   println("My Variable Value is = ${obj.myVar}")
   print("Calling hello(): ")
   obj.hello()
   
   print("Message from the Website-- ")
   println(obj.absMethod())
}

```

The above piece of code will yield the following output:

```
My Variable Value is = 25
Calling hello(): Hello there
Message from the Website-- Keep Learning
```
---

# Data Class
Data class is a simple class which is used to hold data/state and contains standard functionality. A  **data**  keyword is used to declare a class as a data class. There may arise a situation where you need to create a class solely to hold data. These classes are known as  **data class**  or  **data access objects**  or  **data transfer objects** , etc.

The compiler automatically derives the following functions :

- equals()
- hashCode()
- toString()
- copy()

### **Rules to create Data classes –**

Data classes have to fulfill the following requirements to ensure the consistency:

- The primary constructor needs to have at least one parameter.
- All primary constructor parameters need to be marked as _val_ or _var_.
- Data classes cannot be abstract, open, sealed or inner.
- Data classes may only implement interfaces.

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    var user1 = User("Sam", 10)
    var user2 = User("Sam", 10)
    if (user1 == user2)
        println("Equal")
    else
        println("Not equal")
}
class User(var name: String, var id: Int)
```


#### Output:
> Not equal

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    var user1 = User("Sam", 10)
    var user2 = User("Sam", 10)
    println(user1.toString())
    if (user1 == user2)
        println("Equal")
    else
        println("Not equal")
    var newUser = user1.copy(id = 25)
    println(newUser)
}

data class User(var name: String, var id: Int)
```
#### Output:

> User(name=Sam, id=10)
>
> Equal
>
> User(name=Sam, id=25)

# Object Declarations

Singleton Class in Kotlin is also called as the Singleton Object in Kotlin. Singleton class is a class that is defined in such a way that only one instance of the class can be created and used everywhere.

Kotlin provides an easy way to create singletons using the object declaration feature. For that, object keyword is used.
```kotlin
object SingletonExample {
    ... .. ...
    // body of class
    ... .. ...
}
```


The above code combines a class declaration and a declaration of a single instance SingletonExample of the class.

An object declaration can contain properties, methods and so on. However, they are not allowed to have constructors

### **Properties of Singleton Class**

The following are the properties of a typical singleton class:

- **Only one instance** : The singleton class has only one instance and this is done by providing an instance of the class, within the class.
- **Globally accessible** : The instance of the singleton class should be globally accessible so that each class can use it.
- **Constructor not allowed** : We can use the init method to initialize our member variables.

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>)
{
    println(Test.name)
    println("The answer of addition is ${Test.add(3,2)}")
    println("The answer of addition is ${Test.add(10,15)}")
}

object Test
{
    init
    {
        println("Singleton class invoked.")
    }

    var name = "This is a test";

    fun add(num1:Int,num2:Int):Int
    {
        return num1+num2
    }
}
```
#### Output:
> Singleton class invoked.
>
> This is a test
>
> The answer of addition is 5
>
> The answer of addition is 25

---
# Companion Object

There might be a situation where we want to have  **some properties common for all objects**  of the class. These types of properties and methods are known as  **class level fields**. In Kotlin, a  **companion object**  is used to declare the class level fields.

### **Creating and accessing Companion Object**

The companion object is created using the companion keyword. Let us create a class  **Employee**  and create a companion object with name  **Test** :

```kotlin
class Employee {
    var salary:Int = 0
    fun printSalary(){
        println("Salary is: ${this.salary}")
    }
    companion object Test{
        var i: Int = 1
        fun printI(){
            println("Value of i: $i")
            i++
        }
    }
}
```
They can also be accessed using both the class name or the object name.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    Employee.printI()       // Access printI() method using class name
    Employee.Test.printI()  // Access printI() method using class name and companion object name
}
```
#### Output : 
> Value of i: 1
>
> Value of i: 2

Few important points regarding companion objects:

- Companion objects are accessed using the class name instead of object names.
- If the companion object name is missing, the default name Companion is assigned to it.
- There can only be  **one companion object**  in a class.
- A companion object is  **initialized**  when the  **class is loaded**.
- If we try to access class level fields using objects or objects fields using the class name, an error will be thrown.
