# Loops in Kotlin

As in any other programming language, loops in Kotlin are similar. 
It is just that the syntax is a bit different due to the shift in language.

# Basic Definition of Loops
Loops are iterative statements that continue to execute until a condition is fulfilled.

For example you are given a task to print all the natural numbers less than 10.
So we can use a loop to execute this thing. The condition in this case is that 
we will continue printing until the number is less than 10. As soon as it turn 10 we stop printing.

For example refer this diagram.

You can clearly see that we Start the execution. Now we check the condition that is the number greater than 10 or not.
If this condition is **FALSE** we print the number and then increment the number.
If this condition is **TRUE** we end the loop and exit the process.

This was a very example to make the concept of loop clear.

# Types of Loops
Now every programming language has two basic loops:-
- For Loops
- While and Do-While Loops
 Kotlin also supports these loops. But along with these Kotlin has an enhanced version of For loop as well similar to Java.
 I guess the Java people have already guessed it. It is the ***for each loop.***

## For Loop
For loop can iterate through a range or a list of items. Now i will explain what is the difference among these.
Basically anything that provides an iterator, the for loop can iterate through it.

Now what is an iterator? It is a simple concept. Whenever we need to process or acess the elements of a collection one by one sequentially,
we require the iterator. The particualr collection provides an in built iterator to acess each element.

The basic syntax of For loop is
```bash
  for (item in collection){
    // Execute the commands
  }
```
Let's decode the syntax for a deeper understanding of the concept.
**for** is the keyword used to represent For Loop
**collection** is the data structure where the elements are stored.
**item** is the element present in the collection we are accessing.
**in** is the Membership Operator. It ensures that the ***item** is present inside the ***collection*** or not.

Hope it is clear. Let us taken an example to understand it better.

### Example
Suppose we have an array of integers named ***integers***.

integers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

```bash
    for(i in integers){
        println(i) // println is used to print the item
                   // and move the cursor to next line
    }
```

So the output will be 
```bash
1
2
3
4
5
6
```
We also discussed that another way we can iterate using For loop is
through a range. This is used when we do not have a fixed collection but we know between what rangeI need to iterate.

**Syntax**
```bash
for(i in lowerrange..upperrange){
    //Execute commands
}
```
lowerrange..upperrange --> This indicates the range. It baasically means go through all the umbers between the lower range and upper range including both of them.

For example we are asked to print the numbers in between 1 and 3
We can run the followinf piece of code to execute this.
```bash
for(i in 1..3){
    println(i)
}
```
Output will be
```bash
1
2
3
```
We can also iterate through a range of numbers using a keyword called **until**.
What it does is that it specifies that we have to iterate from the Lower range until the Upper Range.
The catch here is that in case of **until** the Upper range is not included as in case of normal iteration in for loop.

```bash
for(i in 0 until 5 step 2){
print(i)
}
```
Output
```bash
0
2
4
```
The step indicates that in each step by how much the iterator **i** will increase.
In this case it is increasing by 2.

We can also iterate in reverse fashion. For this we use the **downTo**
keyword.

```bash
for(i in 6 downTo 0 step 2){
    println(i)
}
```
We are expressing that we want to iterate from 6 to 2 in reverse order. 
The step indicates that in each step by how much the iterator **i** will decrease.
In this case the the i will decrease by 2 in each step until 0.

Output
```bash
6
4
2
0
```

## While Loop
while and do-while loops execute their body continuously while their condition is satisfied. 
The difference between them is the condition checking time:
- ***while loop***: This checks the condition during entering into the loop.This means it checks the condition. If it is satisfied the body is executed and returns to the condition check again.

- ***do-while loop***: It executes the body and then checks the condition. If it's satisfied, the loop repeats. So, the body of 
do-while executes at least once regardless of the condition.

### Example
```bash
val i=0
while(i>3){
    println(i)
}
```
Output
```bash
0
1
2
```
```bash
val i=0
do {
    println(i)
} while (i>3) 
```

Output
```bash
0
1
2
3
```

## For Each Loop
In this we use a ForEach class and its function forEach to iterate each elements in the range or collection.

### Example
```bash
ForEach
(0..10).forEach { 
    println(it) 
}
```
Output
```bash
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```
***it*** refers to the instance. We are refering that print the elements that are in this range. So ***it*** signifies that.

This was all about Loops in Kotlin.
