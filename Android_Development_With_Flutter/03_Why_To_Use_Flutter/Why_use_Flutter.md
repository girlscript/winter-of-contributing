<h3 align="center"> Now that you have understood what Flutter is, you must be curious as to why use Flutter for making Apps when there are other options available too.The major reason for this is the benefits it offers </h3>
<h2 align="center">Benefits of using Flutter for App Development
</h2>
<h3 align="left">- Flutter apps are budget friendly</h3>
<p>Apps developed using Flutter are build in lesser time due to their ease, and thus they are not as expensive as native apps are. It is perfect for startups where you need to test your business model fast.Flutter app development cost will be lower compared to native development for two platforms</p>
<h3 align="left">- Development takes place faster</h3>
<p>Flutter lets programmers use a single codebase, unify their teams, reduce risk, and speed time-to-market. All while getting the benefits of native app look and performance.</p>
<h3 align="left">- The Hot Reload feature</h3>
<p>One of the main feature of Flutter which makes it a favourite among developers is a killer feature called Hot Reload. When a developer clicks the reload button, all code changes are instantly displayed on gadgets, emulators, and simulators.

If programmers change some code in the apps made using Flutter after the recompile, they don't have to navigate back or manually recreate the state to see what changed.

Hot Reload gives Flutter devs the ability to deliver more features in less time. Plus makes it easier to continue adding new features frequently.

<h3 align="left">- Native-like Performance</h3>
<p>In terms of performance, Flutter = native real-time app.
The framework aims to provide 60 fps performance or 120 fps performance on devices capable of 120Hz updates. Apps made in Flutter don't need a bridge to interact with native components (which affects performance) as other frameworks do.</p>
<h2 align="center">Why to use it over traditional android and ios development?
</h2>

</p>
<P>Being a dynamic, cross-platform development framework, it can enrich your app with multiple characteristics and ensure faster development process with engaging User-Interface. Also, its tagline “Build Beautiful Native Apps in Record Time” is the definite highlight of its advantages and capabilities to develop cross-platform apps for iOS and Android using a single codebase.

Despite being the newest member of the cross-platform mobile app development community, Flutter is fastly leaving behind the other frameworks and providing better opportunities to build a feature-rich business mobile app.</P>

<h2 align="center">Which language does Flutter use?
</h2>

</p>
<p>Flutter UIs are built with an imperative, object-oriented language-Dart;the same language used to build Flutter's framework.
  
Dart is a client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform. Its goal is to offer the most productive programming language for multi-platform development, paired with a flexible execution runtime platform for app frameworks.
