Google's Flutter is an open-source user interface software development kit. From a single codebase, it is possible to create apps for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web. Flutter is merely a framework that makes use of the "DART" programming language to deploy code. Dart allows us to construct something for myself and others using a declarative approach.

## System Requirements —

1. Operating system -Windows 7 or later

2. Disk space -400 MB 

   ## Setup instructions for flutter
