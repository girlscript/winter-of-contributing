  </p>
  <h4>Types of User Research tools</h4>
  <li>Quantitative Research - These methods determine user behaviour in such a way that it can be quantified and, consequently, be used for statistical analysis.</li>
  <li>Qualitative Research - These include interviews and, to some extent, usability tests. Qualitative methods are more investigative and help gain an in-depth understanding of the experience of individual users or groups of users.</li>
  <h2><u>Informative Architecture</u></h2>
  <p>Information Architecture structures the various content in a coherent, understandable way</p>
  <p>The structure of content depends on multiple ways</p>
  <li>The needs of the target audience because audience satisfaction is always the priority.</li>
  <li>The type of products and services that a company/business offers.</li>

  <p>Interaction design is an essential component of the vast topic of User Experience (UX). Simply put, it is the design of the technique of interaction between users and products. Interaction Design strives to enable the user to achieve their purpose in the best possible manner.</p>

  <li>Graphics and elements</li>
  <li>Physical objects</li>
  <li>Amount of time spent</li>

  <p>The evaluation of a product by testing it on potential users is known as Usability Testing. This stage in the UX building process allows any required improvements or changes to be made before the product goes out in the market.</p>
  <p>Main methods of usability testing are</p>
  <li>Explorative methods: These methods help UX researchers understand how users/potential users comprehend the concept and usage of a product and the psychology that comes into play when they use the product</li>
  <li>Assessment: The productâ€™s effectiveness is tested via this method, which helps track the userâ€™s reaction and the errors they make in real-time.</li>
  <li>Comparative methods: In this method, users can compare variations of a particular element of the product and then share their opinions with the creative team. This helps in selecting the most user-friendly options</li>
  <h2>Visual Design</h2>

  <p>The way that a product looks affects how the users experience it as well as interact with it. That is what visual design is; it is the implementation of text, colours, and images to enhance the design and interaction of the product.</p>
  <p>Some of the elements of visual design are</p>
  <li>Lines</li> 
<li>Shapes </li>
<li>Fonts </li>
<li>Textures </li>
<li>Negative spaces</li> 
<li>Contrasts</li>

<p>Content strategy is what makes content the king. According to Kristina Halvorson, the author of the book Content Strategy for the Web; Content strategy is the planning for the creation, publication, and governance of valuable and usable content. </p>
<p>There are five stages in the cycle of content: </p>
<li>Analysis and Audit: This includes stakeholder interviews, competition analysis, objective analysis, and evaluation of the content environment.  </li>
<li>Strategy: Sourcing plan, brand definition, workflow for content production is some of the strategy elements.</li>
<li>Plan: Staffing recommendations, communication plans, and migration plans are elements included in the plan stages.</li>
<li>Create: Creating stages include writing the content, search engine optimization, and quality assurance. </li>
<li>Maintenance: Advising the client and determining targets for success measures are aspects of maintenance. </li>
