1. Example Question Statement( Remove this once any question added)
1. Write a program which has Student as the parent class and ScienceStudent, MathsStudent as the subsequent child classes. The parent class has attributes as walks() and talks() . Child classes have studiesScience() and studiesMaths() as methods . Inherit the methods of Student class in ScienceStudent class and the ScienceStudent class in MathsStudent class.
