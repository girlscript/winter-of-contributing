#### Functions : Problem Statement 
e.g. Write a function to add two numbers
   ```
   int add(int a, int b)
{
    int result = a + b;
    return result;
}
  
void main()
{
   var output = add(10, 20);
   print(output);
}
   ```
   From example we can conclude that we are creating a function called **add** and giving necessary datas and returing the output,
   in main function we are calling the function add and passing the inputs and printing the returned result
   ```
   Output : 30
   ```
   #### Solve the following problems:
   1. Take a input from the user and find the factorial of the number using function.
   ```
   Hint: Use standard input to get input form the user
   Syntax:
   print("Enter a number ?");
   int? num = int.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
   ```
   2. Write a function to find  the maximum and minimum number by getting input from the user.
   3. Write a function to find the number is palindrome or not.
