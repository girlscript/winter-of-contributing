        "First things first, let us first understand what orientation is.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Orientation** is nothing but the way a window, or a page or say the screen renders its elements. It is the way how the page is oriented, and how it appears.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Orientation can primarily be classified as Portrait and Landscape.\n",
        "Now, when we build an android application, by default the orientation can change on rotating the screen.\n",
        "\n",
        "The orientation of an android activity can be the following:-\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   PORTRAIT\n",
        "2.   LANDSCAPE\n",
        "3.   UNSPECIFIED \n",
        "4.   SENSOR\n",
        "\n",
        "Let us first see how these four type of orientations differ from each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Portrait can be thought of as a vertical alignment of the components on a page.\n",
        "*   Landscape can be thought of as a horizontal alignment of the components on a page.\n",
        "*  Unspecified orientation means the orientation of the activty will be chosen according to the system's default orientation.\n",
        "*  Sensor orientation as the name suggests is decided by the device orientation sensor.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, to keep a fixed orientation of an activity, we use an attribute named **screenOrientation**. \n",
        "\n",
        "This attribute can have any of the orientation types as its value.\n",
        "It is defined in the *AndroidManifest.xml* file under the *activity* tag.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "<activity\n",
        "            android:name=\".name_of_your_activity\"\n",
        "            android:screenOrientation=\"orientation_type\">\n",
        "</activity>\n",
        "```\n",
        "In the above code *name_of_your_activity* has to be replaced by the name of the activity whose orientation you are setting. \n",
        "The orientation_type will be replaced by the type of orientation you want to give.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, we have talked about how we can fix the orientation. But, in case you have not fixed the orientation and it keeps switching everytime you rotate your screen, there is a problem. The problem is that your activity restarts everytime it switches. To avoid this, we can add one attribute in the *AndroidManifest.xml* file under the *activity* tag to call a function named onConfigurationChanged(). This would prevent the restarting of the activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let us see how we can do this.\n",
        "\n",
        "First in the *AndroidManifest.xml* file under the *activity* tag, add the following code:-\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "            android:configChanges=\"orientation\">\n",
        "</activity>\n",
        "```\n",
        "This attribute will tell the .java file about the change in orientation. Now in your Activity.java file override the onConfigurationChanged method and make the following changes:-\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "@Override\n",
        "    public void onConfigurationChanged(@NonNull Configuration newConfig) {\n",

        "    }\n",
        "```\n",
        "We have talked about the orientation of an android activity, let us talk about the orientation of a layout in an android activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be of two types, horizontal or vertical. As the name suggests, it renders the components as per the orientation defined in the layout. \n",
