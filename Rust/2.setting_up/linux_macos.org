#+TITLE: Linux and MacOS Installation

1. If youâ€™re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:
#+begin_src bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

#+end_src
+ The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the =rustup= tool, which installs the latest stable version of Rust. You might be prompted for your password. If the install is successful, the following line will appear:
 #+begin_src bash
Rust is installed now. Great!
 #+end_src

+ You will also need a linker, which is a program that Rust uses to join its compiled outputs into one file. It is likely you already have one. If you get linker errors, you should install a C compiler, which will typically include a linker. A C compiler is also useful because some common Rust packages depend on C code and will need a C compiler.

+ Linux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their distribution's documentation. For example, if you use Ubuntu, you can install the build-essential package.
