Let’s create a new project with, as always, cargo new. We’ll call our project minigrep to distinguish it from the grep tool that you might already have on your system.

`$ cargo new minigrep
     Created binary (application) minigrep project
$ cd minigrep`

The first task is to make minigrep accept its two command line arguments: the filename and a string to search for. That is, we want to be able to run our program with cargo run, a string to search for, and a path to a file to search in, like so:
`$ cargo run searchstring example-filename.txt`

Right now, the program generated by cargo new cannot process arguments we give it. Some existing libraries on crates.io can help with writing a program that accepts command line arguments, but because you’re just learning this concept, let’s implement this capability ourselves.
