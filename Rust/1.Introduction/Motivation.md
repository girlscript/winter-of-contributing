#  Who Rust Is For ?

+ Rust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. Let’s look at a few of the most important groups.

<br/>

## Teams of Developers :

+ Rust is proving to be a productive tool for collaborating among large teams of developers with varying levels of systems programming knowledge. Low-level code is prone to a variety of subtle bugs, which in most other languages can be caught only through extensive testing and careful code review by experienced developers. In Rust, the **compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs**. By working alongside the compiler, the team can spend their time **focusing on the program’s logic rather than chasing down bugs**.

<br/>

## Students :

+ Rust is for students and those who are **interested in learning about systems concepts**. Using Rust, many people have learned about topics like **operating systems development**. The community is very welcoming and happy to answer student questions.

+ Can create games too , like really good AAA titles . In a few years the frameworks would be there for big game studios to use Rust as a first class choice and develop faster .

<br/>

## Open Source Developers :

+ Rust is for people who want to build the Rust programming language, community, developer tools, and libraries. We’d love to have you contribute to the Rust language.

<br/>

## People Who Value Speed and Stability , well Rust is your friend :

+ Rust is for people who crave speed and stability in a language. By speed, we mean the speed of the programs that you can create with Rust and the speed at which Rust lets you write them. The Rust compiler’s checks ensure stability through feature additions and refactoring .

>Hundreds of companies, large and small, use Rust in production for a **variety of tasks**. Those tasks include command line tools, web services, DevOps tooling, embedded devices, audio and video analysis and transcoding, cryptocurrencies, bioinformatics, search engines, Internet of Things applications, machine learning, and **even major parts of the Firefox web browser**.

<br/>

### Ultimate Goal , atleast what I understand :
+ Rust really provides you the power to manipulate hardware which was not possible using yesteryears' technologies.

+ Levelling the playing field  for developers and tinkers of all kinds .
