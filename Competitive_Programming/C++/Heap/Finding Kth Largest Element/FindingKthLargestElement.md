# Kth Largest Element


Find the kth largest element means that the output will be the kth largest element in the whole array.
<br>

eg : 8 3 5 9 1 2 5 6

<br>

if k = 2
<br>
output: 8 

explanation: 

 the second largest in the array is 8 ,
 sorted array: 1 2 3 5 5 6 8 9

similarily, 
 array[]= 8 3 5 9 1 2 5 6
 if k=5

 output: 3


The Brute Force method to find the kth largest element is to first sort and then find the k-1 index element. This will take O(n log n) time. 

```c++
//c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
vector<int> v={6,5,2,7,1,8,4,9,10,11};
int k=3;
sort(v.begin(),v.end());
cout<<"Kth largest element "<<v[n-k];
return 0;
}
```

>
>Kth largest element 9

where n is the size of the array/vector and sorting takes O(n log n).
Optimized way to solve this is to use min-heap, and this will take O(n log K) time.

- *The property of the min-heap structure is that the minimum element remains at the top*

 - so since, we have to find only the kth largest element so after maintaining the heap of k size
 
  - we can just pop the next top element after we have maintain the k size heap, as the top will always be smaller than the elements below it.

- since we iterate to each element in the array , so it takes O(n) time and for heap function it takes O(log k) , 
so the total complexity becomes O(n log k).


The answer will be at the top of the min heap.

```c++
//c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int findKthLargest(vector<int>nums, int k) {
priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minh;
for (auto i = nums.begin(); i != nums.end(); i++){
 minh.push(*i);
 if(minh.size()>k){
        minh.pop();
    }
}
return minh.top();
}
int main(){
vector<int> v={6,5,2,7,1,8,4,9,10,11};
int k=3;
int ele;
ele=findKthLargest(v,k);
cout<<"Kth largest element "<<ele;
return 0;
}
```
