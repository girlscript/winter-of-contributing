# Sensors Overview
`Sensors` in an android device can be used for many purposes, to add better location capabilities using GPS, to enhance motion capablities using Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and more.

The Android platform supports three broad categories of sensors:

* **Motion sensors** - 
These sensors measure acceleration and rotational forces along x,y,z axes. Examples - Accelerometers, gravity sensors and gyroscopes.

* **Environmental sensors** - 
These sensors measure various environmental parameters, such as air temperature, pressure, and humidity. Examples - barometers and thermometers.

* **Position sensors** - 
These sensors measure the physical position of a device. This category includes orientation sensors, proximity sensors and magnetometers.

## Introduction
Two Types of sensor framework are present in Android Sensor Framework - 
* **Hardware-Based** - They include physical components built into a mobile device which derive data by measuring spcific environmental properties. Examples - Proximity Sensor, Accelerometer.
* **Software-Based** - They derive their data from one or more hardware based sensors, and are also called virtual sensors. Examples - Gravity Sensor, Linear Acceleration Sensor.

Below are some common sensors found inbuilt in an android smartphone -

## Sensor Framework
Android Sensor Framework is used to access raw sensor data, that is a part of `android.hardware` which consists of - 
* **Sensor Manager** - provides various methods for accessing and listing sensors, registering and unregistering sensor event listeners, and acquiring orientation information. It's main purpose is to calibrate sensors.
* **Sensor** - used to create an instance of a specific sensor. It provides various methods that determine a sensor's capabilities.
* **SensorEvent** - this helps to provide information about a sensor event.

### **Identifying Sensor Capabilities**
Android Sensor Framework makes it easier to determine which sensors are present on the device at runtime and capablities of each sensor.

For Identifying the sensors present on device, first we get a reference to the sensor service, then by calling `getSensorList()` method and using the `TYPE_ALL` constant, we get the list of all the sensors present.
```java
private SensorManager sensorManager;
sensorManager = (SensorManager) getSystemService(Context.SENSOR_SERVICE);

List<Sensor> deviceSensors = sensorManager.getSensorList(Sensor.TYPE_ALL);
```
 ***Example -*** 
 Trying to use Gyroscope Sensor of version 3 in an app, if Gyroscope is not present on smart-phone, then we try to use accelerometer.

```java
private SensorManager sensorManager;
private Sensor mySensor;

sensorManager = (SensorManager) getSystemService(Context.SENSOR_SERVICE);
mySensor = null;
if (sensorManager.getDefaultSensor(Sensor.TYPE_GYROSCOPE) != null){
    List<Sensor> gyroscopeSensor = sensorManager.getSensorList(Sensor.TYPE_GYROSCOPE);
    for(int i=0; i<gyroscopeSensor.size(); i++) {
        if (gyroscopeSensor.get(i).getVersion() == 3){
            // Use the version 3 Gyroscope sensor.
            mySensor = gyroscopeSensor.get(i);
        }
    }
}
if (mySensor == null){
    // Use the accelerometer.
    if (sensorManager.getDefaultSensor(Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER) != null){
        mySensor = sensorManager.getDefaultSensor(Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER);
    } else{
        // Sorry, there are no accelerometers on your device.
    }
}
```
