# Getting Started to CameraX
## Introduction
CameraX is a Jetpack support library, built to help you make camera app development easier. It provides a consistent and easy-to-use API surface that works across most Android devices.

CameraX makes it easier to leverage the capablities of Camera 2 APIs by using a simpler approach that is lifecycle-aware and is based on use cases. It also resolves device compatibility issues which saves in including device-specific code in the code base. 

Lastly, CameraX enables developers to leverage the same camera experiences and features that preinstalled camera apps provide, with as little as two lines of code.

## Architecture
There are three types of use cases available to interface CameraX with device's camera which can be used individualy or can be combined to serve a specific purpose:
* Preview - displays the preview with ``` PrivewView ``` on screen.
* Image Analysis - provides buffers for analysis, which can be used for machine learning.
* Image Capture - captures and saves the photo

## Lifecycles
CameraX observes a lifecycle to determine when to open the camera, when to capture, and when to stop. Method calls and callbacks are provided by Use case APIs which is used to monitor progress.

Use cases can also run concurrently, If use cases are bound to a lifecycle, it is better to bind all use cases with a single call to CameraProcessProvider.bindToLifecycle(). 

Following table decribes what configurates are supported in CameraX -

| Preview 	| Analysis 	| Capture 	|                             Combined case                            	|
|:-------:	|:--------:	|:-------:	|:--------------------------------------------------------------------:	|
|    X    	|     X    	|    X    	| See the preview then take that photo for analyzing the image stream. 	|   	
|    X    	|     X    	|         	|  See the preview with proper analysis of the images being streamed.  	|   	
|    X    	|          	|    X    	|      See the preview and click that photo to save it in storage.     	|   	
|         	|     X    	|    X    	|           Click the photo and then perform analysis on it.           	| 
</div>
<br/>

In the following code sample, the app specifies the two use cases to be created and run simultaneously. It also specifies the lifecycle to use for both use cases, so that they both start and stop according to the lifecycle.

```java

private ImageCapture imageCapture;

@Override
public void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    PreviewView previewView = findViewById(R.id.previewView);

    ListenableFuture<ProcessCameraProvider> cameraProviderFuture =
            ProcessCameraProvider.getInstance(this);

    cameraProviderFuture.addListener(() -> {
        try {
            ProcessCameraProvider cameraProvider = cameraProviderFuture.get();

            // First we Set up the view finder display camera preview
            Preview preview = new Preview.Builder().build();

            // Then we take photos using capture use case
            imageCapture = new ImageCapture.Builder()
                    .setCaptureMode(ImageCapture.CAPTURE_MODE_MINIMIZE_LATENCY)
                    .build();

            // Choosing the camera
            CameraSelector cameraSelector = new CameraSelector.Builder()
                    .requireLensFacing(lensFacing)
                    .build();

            // Attach use cases to the camera with the same lifecycle owner
            Camera camera = cameraProvider.bindToLifecycle(
                    ((LifecycleOwner) this),
                    cameraSelector,
                    preview,
                    imageCapture);

            // Connect the preview use case to the previewView
            preview.setSurfaceProvider(
                    previewView.getSurfaceProvider());
        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
            // handle InterruptedException.
        }
    }, ContextCompat.getMainExecutor(this));
}
```
Lets now discuss the seperate Use cases in detail and see how you can implement it in your project.

## Preview Use case
We can preview the image which the camera sees using PreviewView, which is a View that can be cropped, scaled, and rotated for proper display.

You can implement the PreviewView by following steps - 
* First Add a PreviewView to the layout.
```xml
    <FrameLayout
        android:id="@+id/container">
            <androidx.camera.view.PreviewView
                android:id="@+id/previewView" />
    </FrameLayout>
```

* Secondly, Request a ProcessCameraProvider.
```java
    import androidx.camera.lifecycle.ProcessCameraProvider // imports the ProcessCameraProvider
    import com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture

    public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
        private ListenableFuture<ProcessCameraProvider> cameraProviderFuture;

        @Override
        protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            cameraProviderFuture = ProcessCameraProvider.getInstance(this);
        }
    }
```

* When View is created, check for the ProcessCameraProvider.
```java
    cameraProviderFuture.addListener(() -> {
        try {
            ProcessCameraProvider cameraProvider = cameraProviderFuture.get();
            bindPreview(cameraProvider);
        } catch (ExecutionException | InterruptedException e) {
            // This should never be reached.
        }
    }, ContextCompat.getMainExecutor(this));
```

* Lastly, Select a camera and bind the lifecycle and use cases.
```java
    void bindPreview(@NonNull ProcessCameraProvider cameraProvider) {
        Preview preview = new Preview.Builder() // create a preview
                .build();

        CameraSelector cameraSelector = new CameraSelector.Builder()
                .requireLensFacing(CameraSelector.LENS_FACING_BACK) // specify the camera's lensfacing option
                .build();

        preview.setSurfaceProvider(previewView.getSurfaceProvider()); // connect the preview to previewview

        Camera camera = cameraProvider.bindToLifecycle((LifecycleOwner)this, cameraSelector, preview); // bind the camera and use cases 
    }
```

## Image Analysis Use case
This provides the app with a CPU-accessible image on which tasks like image processing, computer vision, or machine learning inference can be done.

You can implement the ImageAnalysis in the android app by following steps - 

* **Build an ImageAnalysis use case**.

    CameraX produces image and ImageAnalysis uses this image to connect the analyzer to CameraX. ImageAnalysis.Builder can be used to build an ImageAnalysis object. 
    With the ImageAnalysis.Builder, application can configure the following Image output parameters:

    * Format: CameraX supports YUV_420_888 and RGBA_8888
    * Resolution and AspectRatio: CameraX supports the configuration of any one, but not both Simultaneously.
    * Rotation: Rotation of smart-phone can be configured.

* **Create an ```ImageAnalysis.Analyzer```**

    In each analyzer, applications receive an ImageProxy, which is a wrapper for Media.Image. The image format can be found out with ImageProxy.getFormat(). 
    When analyzing, following tasks need to be done:

    * Analyze a given frame as quickly as possible, preferably within the given frame rate time limit.
    * If the application can't analyze a frame quickly enough, consider one of the supported frame dropping mechanisms.
    * Release the ImageProxy to CameraX by calling ImageProxy.close().

* **Set your analyzer to your ImageAnalysis**

    When the analyzer is created, use ImageAnalysis.setAnalyzer() to register it to begin analysis.
    Once analysis is completed, use ImageAnalysis.clearAnalyer() to remove the registered analyzer.

* **Bind ImageAnalysis use case to the lifecycle**
    
    Use ```.bindtoLifecycle``` to bind your lifecycle owner, camera selector, and ImageAnalysis use case to the lifecycle.

Following example shows every step in action - 
```java
    ImageAnalysis imageAnalysis =
    new ImageAnalysis.Builder() //imageanalysis is built
        .setTargetResolution(new Size(1280, 720)) //resolution can be set like this
        .setBackpressureStrategy(ImageAnalysis.STRATEGY_KEEP_ONLY_LATEST)
        .build();

    imageAnalysis.setAnalyzer(executor, new ImageAnalysis.Analyzer() { // analyzer is set to imageanalysis
    @Override
    public void analyze(@NonNull ImageProxy imageProxy) {
        int rotationDegrees = imageProxy.getImageInfo().getRotationDegrees();
            // insert your code here.
            ...
            // after done, release the ImageProxy object
            imageProxy.close();
        }
    });

    cameraProvider.bindToLifecycle((LifecycleOwner) this, cameraSelector, imageAnalysis, preview); // imageanalysis is binded 
```

## Image Capture Use case
This use case is used to capture high-resolution image and provides auto-white-balance, auto-exposure, and auto-focus (3A) functionality, in addition to simple manual camera controls and storing the photo in storage.

There are two options to store the image:
* ```takePicture(Executor, OnImageCapturedCallback)```: This method provides an in-memory buffer of the captured image.

* ```takePicture(OutputFileOptions, Executor, OnImageSavedCallback)```: This method saves the captured image to the provided file location.

Image Capture Use case can be implemented by following steps:
* First, configure the camera - 
```java
    ImageCapture imageCapture =
        new ImageCapture.Builder()
            .setTargetRotation(view.getDisplay().getRotation()) //camera is configured
            .build();

    cameraProvider.bindToLifecycle(lifecycleOwner, cameraSelector, imageCapture, imageAnalysis, preview);
```

* Clicking the photo and storing it in storage - 
```java
    public void onClick() { // when capture button is clicked
        ImageCapture.OutputFileOptions outputFileOptions =
                new ImageCapture.OutputFileOptions.Builder(new File(...)).build(); //specify the filepath
        imageCapture.takePicture(outputFileOptions, cameraExecutor,
            new ImageCapture.OnImageSavedCallback() {
                @Override
                public void onImageSaved(ImageCapture.OutputFileResults outputFileResults) { //save the image into the filepath
                    // insert your code here.
                }
                @Override
                public void onError(ImageCaptureException error) {
                    // insert your code here.
                }
        }
        );
    }
```
# Permissions and Dependencies for CameraX
Your app will need the CAMERA permission. 
To save images to files, it will also require the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission, except on devices running Android 10 or later.

To add a dependency on CameraX, you must add the Google Maven repository to your project.

Add the following in build.gradle file for your project:

```java
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google() //add this repository
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```
Add the following to the end of the Android block:

```java
android {
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```
Add the following to each module’s build.gradle file for an app:
```java
dependencies {
  // CameraX core library using the camera2 implementation
  def camerax_version = "1.0.2"
  // The following line is optional, as the core library is included indirectly by camera-camera2
  implementation "androidx.camera:camera-core:${camerax_version}"
  implementation "androidx.camera:camera-camera2:${camerax_version}"
  // If you want to additionally use the CameraX Lifecycle library
  implementation "androidx.camera:camera-lifecycle:${camerax_version}"
  // If you want to additionally use the CameraX View class
  implementation "androidx.camera:camera-view:1.0.0-alpha31"
  // If you want to additionally use the CameraX Extensions library
  implementation "androidx.camera:camera-extensions:1.0.0-alpha31"
}
```
