# **Nested Scroll View**

Scroll View is while reading a pdf or a going through the feed in Instagram we scroll to move further pages and to see more posts respectively.  
Similarly, NestedScrollView is just like ScrollView, but it supports acting as both a nested scrolling parent and child. It is enabled by default. As the Name suggests, NestedScrollView is a widget that is used when we want to implement scrollable view inside another scrollable view.  
You have seen this in many apps for example when we open a pdf file and when we reached the end of the PDF there is an Ad below the pdf file. This would be difficult for the system as it have to decide which view to Scroll. So, this is where NestedScrollView comes in.  
<br>
Lets undestand this with an example:
<br><br>

### **Step 1: Create a New Project**

Follow steps below to create new project. Please ignore the steps if you have already created a new application.
<br><br>

|Step|Description|
|----|-----------|
|1.|Open Android Studio|
|2.|Go to **File** => **New** => **New Project**. Write application name as **Nested App**. Then click **next**.|
|3.|Select minimum SDK you need. However, we have selected 17 as minimum SDK. Then, click **next** button.|
|4.|Then, select **Empty Activity** => click **next** => click **finish**.|

<br>

Now, we will modify xml and java file to use nestedScrollView widget in the application.

<br>

### **Step 2: Modifying XML file**

Go to the **app** -> **res** -> **values** -> **strings.xml** and add two random text strings inside the strings.xml file to display those strings in the activity_main.xml file.

Created by Patrice Désilets, Jade Raymond, and Corey May, the Assassin\'s Creed series depicts a fictional millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through order and control. The series features historical fiction, science fiction and fictional characters intertwined with real-world historical events and figures. In the majority of the games, players control a historical Assassin, while also playing as an Assassin Initiate or someone caught in the Assassin-Templar conflict in the present-day framing story. The series took inspiration from the novel Alamut by the Slovenian writer Vladimir Bartol, based on the historical Hashashin sect of the medieval Middle East,[1] while building upon concepts from the Prince of Persia series.[2] The series\'s eponymous first title was released in 2007, and it has featured twelve main games in total, the most recent being 2020\'s Valhalla. Main games of Assassin\'s Creed are set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective where the protagonists take down targets using their combat and stealth skills with the exploitation of the environment. Players have freedom to explore the historical settings as they finish main and side quests. Apart from single-player missions, some games also provide competitive and cooperative multiplayer gameplay. A new story and occasional new time period are introduced in each entry, and gameplay elements evolve from the previous one. There are three overarching story arcs in the series. The first five main games follow Desmond Miles, a descendant of several important Assassins throughout history, who uses a machine called the Animus to relive his ancestors\' memories and find powerful artifacts called \"Pieces of Eden\", while also attempting to prevent a catastrophic event said to wipe out humanity by the end of 2012. From Assassin\'s Creed IV: Black Flag and until Assassin\'s Creed Syndicate, Assassin initiates and employees of Abstergo (a company used as a cover by the modern-day Templars) record genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The latest three games, Assassin\'s Creed Origins, Assassin\'s Creed Odyssey, and Assassin\'s Creed Valhalla, follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan and her own quest to save humanity from another disaster.

### **Step 3: Designing UI**

In the activity_main.xml file add the NestedScrollView and inside NestedScrollView add a LinearLayout and inside LinearLayout add two TextView to display the strings which are created inside the strings.xml file and one Button between the TextView. Here is the code for the activity_main.xml file. One can add as many views inside the NestedScrollView’s Linear Layout.

~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".MainActivity">

    <androidx.core.widget.NestedScrollView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_marginStart="35dp"
        android:layout_marginTop="25dp"
        android:layout_marginEnd="35dp"
        android:fillViewport="true"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent">

        <LinearLayout
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            android:orientation="vertical">

            <ImageView
                android:id="@+id/imageView4"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="200dp"
                app:srcCompat="@drawable/img1"
                android:contentDescription="@string/todo" />

            <Button
                android:id="@+id/button"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:text="@string/nested_scroll_view" />

            <TextView
                android:id="@+id/textView2"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:text="@string/text_name1" />
        </LinearLayout>
    </androidx.core.widget.NestedScrollView>
</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
~~~
<br>

### **Step 4: Working with main Java file**  
<br>

There is no need of changing the **MainActivity.java**, so keep it as it is.

And for the referrence below is the code of the **MainActivity.java** file:

~~~
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

	@Override
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
		setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
	}
}
~~~
