# **Nested Scroll View**

Scroll View is while reading a pdf or a going through the feed in Instagram we scroll to move further pages and to see more posts respectively.  
Similarly, NestedScrollView is just like ScrollView, but it supports acting as both a nested scrolling parent and child. It is enabled by default. As the Name suggests, NestedScrollView is a widget that is used when we want to implement scrollable view inside another scrollable view.  
You have seen this in many apps for example when we open a pdf file and when we reached the end of the PDF there is an Ad below the pdf file. This would be difficult for the system as it have to decide which view to Scroll. So, this is where NestedScrollView comes in.  
<br>
Lets undestand this with an example:
<br><br>

### **Step 1: Create a New Project**

Follow steps below to create new project. Please ignore the steps if you have already created a new application.
<br><br>

|Step|Description|
|----|-----------|
|1.|Open Android Studio|
|2.|Go to **File** => **New** => **New Project**. Write application name as **Nested Scroll View**. Then click **next**.|
|3.|Select minimum SDK you need. However, we have selected 17 as minimum SDK. Then, click **next** button.|
|4.|Then, select **Empty Activity** => click **next** => click **finish**.|

<br>

Now, we will modify xml and java file to use nestedScrollView widget in the application.

<br>

### **Step 2: Modifying XML file**

Go to the **app** -> **res** -> **values** -> **strings.xml** and add two random text strings inside the strings.xml file to display those strings in the activity_main.xml file.

		because of Hadoop. Hadoop helps the industry to know their customer’s behavior,
		customers buying priorities i.e. what they loved the most, and click patterns,
		etc. Hadoop provides personalized recommendations and personalizes ad targeting
		features. Companies are generating thousands of petabytes of data every day so the
		demand for Big Data professionals is very high. Even after a few years,
		Hadoop will be considered as the must-learn skill for the data-scientist
		and Big Data Technology. Companies are investing big in it and it will become
		an in-demand skill in the future. Hadoop provides personalized recommendations

		Humans are coming closer to the internet at a very fast rate. It means that the
		volume of data Industries is gathering will increase as time passes because of
		more users. Industry’s are gradually analyzing the need for this useful information

		an increasing pattern so the company’s are eventually acquiring professionals
		skilled with Big Data Technologies. According to NASSCOM, India’s Big Data
		Market will reach 16 billion USD by 2025 from 2 billion USD. The growth of smart
		devices in India is growing at a very huge rate that will cause growth in the

### **Step 3: Designing UI**

In the activity_main.xml file add the NestedScrollView and inside NestedScrollView add a LinearLayout and inside LinearLayout add two TextView to display the strings which are created inside the strings.xml file and one Button between the TextView. Here is the code for the activity_main.xml file. One can add as many views inside the NestedScrollView’s Linear Layout.

~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout
	xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
	xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
	android:layout_width="match_parent"
	android:layout_height="match_parent"
	tools:context=".MainActivity">

	<!-- Nested Scroll view -->
	<androidx.core.widget.NestedScrollView
		android:layout_width="match_parent"
		android:layout_height="wrap_content">

		<!-- Linear layout to contain 2 text view and button -->
		<LinearLayout
			android:layout_width="match_parent"
			android:layout_height="wrap_content"
			android:orientation="vertical">

			<!-- showing random text 1 from strings.xml file -->
			<TextView
				android:layout_width="match_parent"
				android:layout_height="wrap_content"
				android:text="@string/random_text_1" />

			<!-- simple button -->
			<Button
				android:layout_width="match_parent"
				android:layout_height="160dp"
				android:background="@color/colorPrimary"
				android:text="Nested Scroll View "
				android:textColor="#ffffff"
				android:textSize="32dp" />

			<!-- showing random text 2 from strings.xml file -->
			<TextView
				android:layout_width="match_parent"
				android:layout_height="wrap_content"
				android:text="@string/random_text_2" />
			
		</LinearLayout>
		
	</androidx.core.widget.NestedScrollView>

</RelativeLayout>

### **Step 4: Working with main Java file**  
<br>

There is no need of changing the **MainActivity.java**, so keep it as it is.

And for the referrence below is the code of the **MainActivity.java** file:

~~~
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

	@Override
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
		setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
	}
}
~~~
