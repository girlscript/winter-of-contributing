RecyclerView is very useful and it is useful as it accurately displays large data sets. You submit your data and give explanantion of what each item looks like, and the RecyclerView library will them create items when needed.

Now it is clear from the name that `RecyclerView` is used to updated those single items. When an object scratches off the screen, RecyclerView does not spoil its view. Instead, RecyclerView takes advantage of new screen-scripted views. This reuse improves performance, improves your app's responsiveness and reduces power consumption.

Note: In addition to being a category name, RecyclerView is also a library name. On this page, RecyclerView in the code font always refers to the section in the RecyclerView library.

## Key classes

Many different classes work together to build your dynamic list.

- `RecyclerView` is `ViewGroup` containing views associated with your data. The idea itself, so add `RecyclerView` to your layout the way you would add any other UI item.

- Each item in the list is defined by a holding * object. When the view handle is created, it has no related data. After the view handle is created, `RyyclerView` * binds * it to its data. Define the holder by viewing `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`.
- `RecyclerView` requests those views, and binds views to their data, by tapping the paths on the * adapter. * Define the adapter by extending `RecyclerView.Adapter`.

- The * layout manager organizes each item in your list. You can use one of the property managers provided with the RecyclerView library, or you can define your own. Building managers are all based on the `LayoutManager` section.

## Steps for implementing your RecyclerView

If you are going to use RecyclerView, there are a few things you need to do. The following categories will be discussed in more detail.

- First, decide what the list or grid will look like. You will usually be able to use the standard archive managers of the RecyclerView library.

- Create what each item on the list will look like and behave. Depending on the design, expand the `ViewHolder` section. Your `ViewHolder` version provides all the functionality of your listing items. Your watch manager is threatened with views, and that `view` is managed by `RecyclerView`.

- Define `Adapter` that associates your data with `ViewHolder` views.

There are also [advanced customization options](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview-custom) that allow you to customize your RecyclerView to your specific needs.

## Plan your Layout-:

The items in your RecyclerView are orgnised int theÂ [`LayoutManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.LayoutManager)Â section. The RecyclerView library provides us with 3 different edifice administrants, which are used to manage the most common layout situations:

-   [`LinearLayoutManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/LinearLayoutManager)Â organises the items in 1-D list.
-   [`GridLayoutManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/GridLayoutManager)Â organises all the items in 2-D grid:
    -  When the grid is set vertically, GridLayoutManager tries to make everything in each row have them the same amplitude and length, but different lines may have different heights.
    -   If the grid is organized horizontally, GridLayoutManager tries to do everything in each column has the same width and height, but different columns may have different widths.
-   [`StaggeredGridLayoutManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/StaggeredGridLayoutManager)Â is kond of similar toÂ `GridLayoutManager`, but does not need those consecutive items in a row that have the same height (for vertical grids) or objects in the same column have the same width (for horizontal grids). 
The result is that the items in a row or column can end up offset from each other.

You'll also need to design the layout of the individual items. You'll need this layout when you design the view holder, as described in the next section.

## Implementing your adapter and view holder

Once you have found your composition, you need to implement yourÂ `Adapter`Â andÂ `ViewHolder`. These two classes together will work to define how your data can be displayed. TheÂ `ViewHolder`Â is a wrapper around theÂ `View`Â that contains the composition of each item in the list. TheÂ `Adapter`Â createsÂ `ViewHolder`Â objects according to the need, and also sets the data for that view. The process of combining views to their data is calledÂ *binding.*

When defining your adapter, you need to write down 3 important steps:

-   [`onCreateViewHolder()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter#onCreateViewHolder(android.view.ViewGroup,%20int)):Â  Whenever there is a need to create a new `ViewHolder` the `RecyclerView` calls this method. This method creates and opens theÂ `ViewHolder`Â and its associatedÂ `View`, but doesÂ *not*Â fill the viewing contents---theÂ `ViewHolder`Â has not yet been bound to specific data.

-   [`onBindViewHolder()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter#onBindViewHolder(VH,%20int)):`RecyclerView` calls this technique to associate a `ViewHolder` with data. The appropiate data is ran by the technique and this data is used to fill in the view holder's layout. For specimen, if the `RecyclerView` displays a list of words, the technique can find the correct word in the list and fill in the [`TextView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView) widget  for the view owner.

-   [`getItemCount()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter#getItemCount()): RecyclerView calls this technique to get the size of the data set. For specimen, in an address book app, this might be the total number of addresses. RecyclerView uses this to determine when there are no other points that can be displayed.

Presently is a typical representative of a simple attachment with a nested ViewHolder that displays a list of data. In this case, the RecyclerView displays a simple list of textbook principles. An array of strings is passed in in the adapter which contains the text for theÂ `ViewHolder`Â elements.

```java

public class CustomAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<CustomAdapter.ViewHolder> {

    private String[] localDataSet;

    /**
     * Provide a reference to the type of views that you are using
     * (custom ViewHolder).
     */
    public static class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
        private final TextView textView;

        public ViewHolder(View view) {
            super(view);
            // Define click listener for the ViewHolder's View

            textView = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.textView);
        }

        public TextView getTextView() {
            return textView;
        }
    }

    /**
     * Initialize the dataset of the Adapter.
     *
     * @param dataSet String[] containing the data to populate views to be used
     * by RecyclerView.
     */
    public CustomAdapter(String[] dataSet) {
        localDataSet = dataSet;
    }

    // Create new views (invoked by the layout manager)
    @Override
    public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup viewGroup, int viewType) {
        // Create a new view, which defines the UI of the list item
        View view = LayoutInflater.from(viewGroup.getContext())
                .inflate(R.layout.text_row_item, viewGroup, false);

        return new ViewHolder(view);
    }

    // Replace the contents of a view (invoked by the layout manager)
    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder viewHolder, final int position) {

        // Get element from your dataset at this position and replace the
        // contents of the view with that element
        viewHolder.getTextView().setText(localDataSet[position]);
    }

    // Return the size of your dataset (invoked by the layout manager)
    @Override
    public int getItemCount() {
        return localDataSet.length;
    }
}
```

The layout for the each view item is defined in an XML layout file, as usual. In this case, the app has aÂ `text_row_item.xml`Â file like this:

```xml
<FrameLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="@dimen/list_item_height"
    android:layout_marginLeft="@dimen/margin_medium"
    android:layout_marginRight="@dimen/margin_medium"
    android:gravity="center_vertical">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/textView"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="@string/element_text"/>
</FrameLayout>
```

At the end recycler view has this output as shown-:

<div align = center>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Linear Layout Manager
    </td>
    <td>
      Grid Layout Manager
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/android/views-widgets-samples/main/RecyclerView/screenshots/1-linear.png" height=620px width=300px>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/android/views-widgets-samples/main/RecyclerView/screenshots/2-grid.png" height=620px width=300px>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
