  # Layouts in Android
</div>

About:

In Android, the layout is used to describe the user interface that
contains the UI controls or widgets that would display on an android
device or operation screen. Layout specifies the various widgets to be
used in the UI and the relationships between such widgets and their
containers.

Layout files are stored in \"res-\> layout\" in the Android application.
When we open the resource of the application, we find the layout files
of the Android application.

The layout must contain only one root, View or ViewGroup object. Once we
define the root element, then we can add additional layout objects or
widgets as child elements to build the View hierarchy that defines our
layout. These layouts can have various widgets like buttons, labels,
textboxes, and many others.

In android, we can define a layout in two ways, those are

-   Declare UI elements in XML

-   Instantiate layout elements at runtime

The Android framework will allow us to use either or both of these
methods to define our application's UI.

**Quick Glance**: A **View** is a simple building block of a user
interface. It is a small rectangular box that can be TextView, EditText,
or even a button. The view is a superclass of all the graphical user
interface components. A **View Group** is a subclass of the ViewClass
and can be considered as a superclass of Layouts. It provides an
invisible container to hold the views or layouts. ViewGroup instances
and views work together as a container for Layouts.

Android Layout Attributes:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Attributes of Layout**                   
  ----------------------------- -----------------------------------------
  **android:id**                  -  It uniquely defines the identity of View
                                 and ViewGroups in a layout.

  **android:layout_width**        -  It defines the width of View and
                                 ViewGroup elements in a layout.

  **android:layout_height**       -  It defines the height of View and
                                 ViewGroup elements in a layout.

  **android:layout_marginLeft**   -  It defines the extra space in the left
                                 side of View and ViewGroup elements in a
                                 layout.

  **android:layout_marginRight**  -  It defines the extra space on the right
                                 side of View and ViewGroup elements in a
                                 layout.

  **android:layout_marginTop**    -  It defines the extra space on the top of
                                 View and ViewGroup elements in a layout.

  **android:layout_marginBottom** -  It defines the extra space on the bottom
                                 of View and ViewGroup elements in a
                                 layout.

  **android:paddingLeft**         -  It defines the left-side padding for View
                                 and ViewGroup elements in the layout
                                 files.

  **android:paddingRight**        - It defines the right-side padding for
                                View and ViewGroup elements in the layout
                                files.

  **android:paddingTop**          - It defines the top-side padding for View
                                and ViewGroup elements in the layout
                                files.

  **android:paddingBottom**       - It defines the bottom-side of the padding
                                for View and ViewGroup elements in the
                                layout files.

  **android:layout_gravity**      - It defines the position of child View.

  **android:layout_x**            - It defines the x-coordinate of a layout.

  **android:layout_y**            - It defines the y-coordinate of a layout.
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Look at the below code to understand width and height attributes.

> \<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\
> \<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout\
> xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" \
> xmlns:app=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto" \
> xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools] \
> android:layout_width=\"match_parent"\
> android:layout_height=\"wrap_content"\
> tools:context=\".MainActivity">\
> \</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>

If you observe the above example, we used different values to set
**layout_width** and **layout_height**, those are

-   match_parent

-   Wrap_content

If we set the value **match_parent**, then the View or ViewGroup will
try to match with parent width or height.

If we set the value **wrap_content**, then the View or ViewGroup will
try to adjust its width or height based on the content.

View and ViewGroup hierarchy can be understood as :

![Views](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58635404/134561298-46db0b23-57a5-41bf-be2f-acadd772c8c1.jpg)

All the Layouts are built as per the hierarchy and the root of the
layout.

Android Layout Types:

Different types of layouts in android are as follows:

-   Linear layout

-   Relative layout

-   Constraint layout

-   Table layout

-   Absolute layout

-   Frame layout

-   Grid Layout

-   ListView

-   ScrollView

-   WebView

Every layout is discussed briefly in subsequent parts.

Below pictorial representation will further help you to visualize these
layouts.
