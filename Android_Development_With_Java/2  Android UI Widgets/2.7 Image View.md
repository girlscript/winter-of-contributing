# Image View
Image View is used to display Images in our App. To add an Image, the following steps should be followed :
 1) Add the image in drawable folder 
 2) Use android:src attribute to use that image in Image View.

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79036525/136585411-4ca6cdda-feb6-4031-95a9-a32aac23121e.png">
 </p>
 
  ```XML
  <ImageView
        android:id="@+id/imageView"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:src="@drawable/gwoc"/>
        
  ```
            
  
  Sometimes we need to change the image during run time. For that, we can use the following Java Code to change the image programmatically.
  
   ```JAVA
      ImageView imageView=findViewById(R.id.imageView);
        imageView.setImageResource(R.drawable.image_name);
   ```
        
 Images can be scaled using android:scaleType attribute.
 1) center - It centers the image in the ImageView without any scaling.
 2) centerCrop	- It scales image uniformly in the center. Both dimensions will be equal to or larger than than the View's dimensions.
 3) centerInside	- It scales image uniformly in the center. Both dimensions will be equal to or smaller than than the View's dimensions.
 4) fitStart - It scales the image to the start of the View
 5) fitEnd - It scales the image to the end of the View.


If we use vector images, we can change the color of the image by using android:tint attribute.
