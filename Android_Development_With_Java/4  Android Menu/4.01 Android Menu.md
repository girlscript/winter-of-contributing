## Android Menus

**Menus are a common user interface component in many types of applications. To provide a familiar and consistent user experience.**

We Inflate the menu by calling the `inflate()` method of MenuInflater class. To perform event handling on menu items, we need to override the `onOptionsItemSelected()` method of the Activity class.

### Defining Menu in XML File?

Android Studio provides a standard XML format for the type of menus to define menu items. We can simply define the `menu` and all its items in an XML menu resource instead of building the menu in the code and also load the menu resource as a menu object in the activity or fragment used in our android application.

We should create a new folder menu inside of our project directory `(res/menu)` to define the menu and also add a new `XML` file to build the menu with the following elements.

> XML
 
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<menu xmlns:android="http:// schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
	<item android:id="@+id/mail"
		android:icon="@drawable/ic_mail"
		android:title="@string/mail" />
	<item android:id="@+id/upload"
		android:icon="@drawable/ic_upload"
		android:title="@string/upload"
		android:showAsAction="ifRoom" />
	<item android:id="@+id/share"
		android:icon="@drawable/ic_share"
		android:title="@string/share" />
</menu>

```

## Android Different Types of Menus

In android, we have three types of Menus available to define a set of options and actions in our android applications.

* **Options Menu**
* **Context Menu**
* **Popup Menu**

### Android Options Menu -

**This menu is usually found at the top of your application and in it, you should place actions that affect the application as a whole. These could be the application’s settings or a search box.**

### Android Context Menu -
 
**This menu appears when a user performs a long click on one of your UI elements. The options found in this menu affect what UI element the user made the click on. It is common to use this type of menu in list or grid views, where the user’s interaction with each item can lead to a specific action.**

### Android Popup Menu -

**A popup menu is a type of menu that displays items in a vertical list. This list is attached to the view the user has clicked on to invoke this menu. It is important to keep in mind, that when choosing a popup menu, you do not want the user’s choice to affect the previous content the user pressed.**
