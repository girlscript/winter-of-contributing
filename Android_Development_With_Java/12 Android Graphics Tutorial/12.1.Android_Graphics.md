#### Android Graphics

---

##### Introduction

- Android provides a huge set of 2D-drawing APIs that allow you to create graphics.
- Android has got visually appealing graphics and mind blowing animations.
- The Android framework provides a rich set of powerful APIS for applying animation to UI elements and graphics as well as drawing custom 2D and 3D graphics.

##### Animations

- There are three types of Animations:

1. Property Animation
2. View Animation
3. Drawable Animation

Property Animation:

- Property animation is the preferred method of animation in Android.
- This animation is the robust framework which lets you animate any properties of any objects, view or non-view objects.
- The <b>android.animation</b> provides classes which handle property animation.

View Animation:

- View Animation is also called as <b>Tween Animation.</b>
- The <b>android.view.animation</b> provides classes which handle view animation.
- This animation can be used to animate the content of a view.
- It is limited to simple transformation such as moving, re-sizing and rotation, but not its background color.

Drawable Animation:

- Drawable animation is implemented using the AnimationDrawable class.
- This animation works by displaying a running sequence of 'Drawable' resources that is images, frame by frame inside a view object.

##### Canvas

- Android graphics provides low level graphics tools such as canvases, color, filters, points and rectangles which handle drawing to the screen directly.
- The Android framework provides a set of 2D-DRAWING APIs which allows user to provide own custom graphics onto a canvas or to modify existing views to customize their look and feel.

There are two ways in which we can draw 2D graphics, these are:

1. Draw your animation into a View object from your layout.
2. Draw your animation directly to a Canvas.

Some important methods of Canvas Class are as follows:

1. `drawText()`
2. `drawRoundRect()`
3. `drawCircle()`
4. `drawRect()`
5. `drawBitmap()`
6. `drawARGB()`

- You can use these methods in onDraw() method to create your own custom user interface.
- Drawing an animation with a View is the best option to draw simple graphics that do not need to change dynamically and are not a part of a performance-intensive game. It is used when user wants to display a static graphic or predefined animation.
- Drawing an animation with a Canvas is better option when your application needs to re-draw itself regularly. For example video games should be drawing to the Canvas on its own.

- The <b>android.graphics.Canvas</b> can be used to draw graphics in android. It provides methods to draw oval, rectangle, picture, text, line etc.
- The <b>android.graphics.Paint</b> class is used with canvas to draw objects. It holds the information of color and style.

Example 1:
Create a new Java class that should extend from View class. Override the onDraw() method. In this method, you can use Canvas class to draw the different shapes.

File Name: MyView.java

```
public class MyView extends View
{
      public MyView(Context context)
      {
           super(context);
           // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
       }
       @Override
       protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas)
       {
             // TODO Auto-generated method stub
             super.onDraw(canvas);
             int radius;
             radius = 50;
             Paint paint = newPaint();
             paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL);
             paint.setColor(Color.parseColor("#CD5C5C"));
             canvas.drawCircle(150,200, radius, paint);
             canvas.drawRoundRect(newRectF(20,20,100,100), 20, 20, paint);
             canvas.rotate(-45);
             canvas.drawText("TutorialRide", 40, 180, paint);
             canvas.restore();
        }
}
```

File Name: MainActivity.java

<b>Note:</b> You have to pass the object of subclass that extends from View class in setContentView() method as given below. In our case the name of the subclass is MyView.

```
Public class MainActivity extends Activity
{
      @Override
      protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
      {
           super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
           setContentView(new MyView(this));
      }
      @Override
      public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu)
      {
            // Inflate the menu; this adds items to the action bar if it is present.
            getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.main, menu);
            return true;
      }
}
```

Example 2:
In this example, we are going to display 2D graphics in android.

File Name: activity_main.xml

```
<RelativeLayout xmlns:androclass="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:paddingBottom="@dimen/activity_vertical_margin"
    android:paddingLeft="@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin"
    android:paddingRight="@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin"
    android:paddingTop="@dimen/activity_vertical_margin"
    tools:context=".MainActivity" >

    <TextView
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="@string/hello_world" />

</RelativeLayout>
```

File Name: MainActivity.java

```
package com.example.simplegraphics;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.app.Activity;
import android.view.Menu;
import android.content.Context;
import android.graphics.Canvas;
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.graphics.Paint;
import android.view.View;

public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    DemoView demoview;
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        demoview = new DemoView(this);
        setContentView(demoview);
    }

    private class DemoView extends View{
        public DemoView(Context context){
            super(context);
        }

        @Override protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
            super.onDraw(canvas);

            // custom drawing code here
            Paint paint = new Paint();
            paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL);

            // make the entire canvas white
            paint.setColor(Color.WHITE);
            canvas.drawPaint(paint);

            // draw blue circle with anti aliasing turned off
            paint.setAntiAlias(false);
            paint.setColor(Color.BLUE);
            canvas.drawCircle(20, 20, 15, paint);

            // draw green circle with anti aliasing turned on
            paint.setAntiAlias(true);
            paint.setColor(Color.GREEN);
            canvas.drawCircle(60, 20, 15, paint);

            // draw red rectangle with anti aliasing turned off
            paint.setAntiAlias(false);
            paint.setColor(Color.RED);
            canvas.drawRect(100, 5, 200, 30, paint);

            // draw the rotated text
            canvas.rotate(-45);

            paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL);
            canvas.drawText("Graphics Rotation", 40, 180, paint);

            //undo the rotate
            canvas.restore();
        }
    }
    @Override
    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        // Inflate the menu; this adds items to the action bar if it is present.
        getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.main, menu);
        return true;
    }
}
```
