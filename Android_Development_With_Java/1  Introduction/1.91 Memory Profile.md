* **`Java`** : Memory from objects that Java/Kotlin has allocated.
* **`Native`**: Allocated memory from C/C++ code objects.
* **`Graphics`**: Memory to display pixels to the screen.
* **`Stack`**: Memory used by both native and Java stacks in your app. When your app invokes a method, a block is created in the stack memory to hold local primitive values and * references to other objects in this method.
* **`Code`**: Memory used for code and resources such as dex bytecode, .so libraries and fonts.
* **`Others`**: Memory that the system doesn’t know how to categorize.
* **`Allocated`**: The number of Java/Kotlin objects your app has allocated.
