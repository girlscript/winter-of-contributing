### Dalvik-Virtual-Machine

---

### Introduction:

The Dalvik Virtual Machine(DVM), is a custom VM which was developed by Google for Android. The Android operating system is built over the Linux kernel. Android applications are in the Java programming language which executes programs in a virtual machine also called as JVM(Java Virtual Machine).

DVM has been developed to run multiple Virtual Machines efficiently for different apps. DVM has managed runtime used by apps. All Android apps execute an instance of DVM, which in turn executes the machine code by the Linux-kernel.

DVM uses the .dex format instead of the .jar format used fir JVM. The dex is optimised for low memory requirements.

### Application:

- Uses registers of CPU to store the operands, and it does not require any addition and removal of instructions, therefore making execution much faster.

- Instructions work on virtual registers.

- Uses regsiter-based models, which are good at optimizing and running on low memory

- They can store common sub-expression results which can be reused later at anytime.

### Advantages:

- DVM only supports the Android OS.
- Execution is much faster.
- DVM has it's own Just In Time(JIT) compiler from Android 2.2 SDK.
- DVM makes sure devices can multiple instances of the VM effectively.
- Apps are given their own instances.

### Disadvantages:

- Lack of support for other Mobile Operating Systems
- Very few Re-tools are available for DVM, which is not good.
- Usually requires more instructions than register machines to implement the same high-level code
- Due to dex, App Installation takes more time
- More internal storage is needed.
