# 1.4 Creating First Project

In this tutorial, we'll see creating the first project in Android studio. This tutorial is for absolute beginners in Android development. 

+ First of all click on the "Create New Project".

+ Now select the desired predefined Activity Templates based on your requirements, because we are simply creating an app so select "Empty Activity" and click "Next". If you want to work on Maps then select Google Map Activity.

+ Activity Templates for other Android Things

+ <h3>Configure the Project</h3>
   After selecting the activity, now next step is to configure the some settings as described below.<br>

  1. Specify the "Name" of the project. <br>
  2. Specify the "Package name". By default, this package name also becomes your application ID, which you can change later. <br>
  3. Specify the "Save location" where you want to locally store your project. <br>
  4. Select the Language you want Android Studio to use when creating sample code for your new project. As we are creating Java Application select "Java". Keep in mind, you     are not limited to using only that language creating the project. <br>
  5. Select the "Minimum API level" you want your app to support. When you select a lower API level, your app can rely on fewer modern Android APIs. However, a larger           percentage of Android devices are able to run your app. The opposite is true when selecting a higher API level. If you want to see more data to help you decide, click "Help me choose".
  6. If you want your project to use "AndroidX libraries" by default, which are improved replacements of the Android Support libraries, check the box next to Use AndroidX       artifacts. <br>
  When you're finish all the configuration settings to create your project, click "Finish". <br>
  
  
  Android Studio creates your new project with some basic code and resources to get you started. If you later decide to add support for a different device form factor, you can add a module to your project later. And if you want to share code and resources between modules, you can do so by creating an Android library. <br><br>


+ <h3>Import an existing project</h3>
  To import an existing, local project into Android Studio, proceed as follows:<br>
   1. Click "File > New > Import Project". <br>
   2. In the window that appears, navigate to the root directory of the project you want to import. <br>
   3. Click "OK". <br>
  Android Studio then opens the project in a new IDE window and indexes its contents. <br><br>
