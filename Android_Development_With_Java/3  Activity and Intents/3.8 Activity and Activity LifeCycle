 <hr> </hr>



## **What is activity in android?**

 > An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do. Almost all activities interact with the user. An Android app may contain one or more activities,
 > meaning one or more screens. The Android app starts by showing the main activity, and from there the app may make it possible to open additional activities.

##  **What is activity life cycle in android?**

> An activity has various stages in its lifecycle. To transit from one stage to the other stage of the activity lifecycle activity class has six methods which are 
> overided by the developers according to the need. These methods are termed as callbacks. The six callbacks are :
## **Methods to handle activity life cycle :-**
### 1.  onCreate()

### 2.  onStart()

### 3.  onResume()

### 4.  onPause()

### 5.  onStop()

### 6.  onDestroy()

### 1.  *onCreate()*: 
  >  It displays the UI given in the XML file when the activity starts . It calls the SetContentView() method.

### 2.  *onStart():* 
  >  when our activity is in process to be displayed this callback method is called .And after this method onResume() callbackis called.

### 3.  *onResume()* :
  >  The core functionality of application is written within this callback method.When the activity is just about to bedisplayed this callback method 
  >  is called .Suppose if you start a new activity that hides the already ongoing activity , onResume() is called when the activity that was hidden comes back to 
  > the view on the screen again.

### *4.  onPause()*: 
  >  The code you want to be executed when app is being paused (minimised ) should be wriiten in this callback method and when the user resumes to the
  >  application onResume() callback method will be called again.

### 5.  *onStop():* 
  >  when an activity is being minimised onPause() callback is immediately called and after a few miliseconds onStop will be called.onStop() will stop 
  >  the API calls of the application.

### 6.  *onDestroy():* 
  >  onDestroy callback is to be called when you need to shutdown all the operations .

## **Starting Activities and Getting Results**

   >  The *startActivity(Intent)* method is used to start a new activity,which will be placed at the top of the activity stack. It takes a single argument,an 
   >  [*Intent*](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent),which describes the activity to be executed.
   
   >  Sometimes you want to get a result back from an activity when it ends. For example, you may start an activity that lets the user pick a person in a list of contacts; 
   >  when it ends, it returns the person that was selected. To do this, you call the *startActivityForResult(Intent,int)* version with a second integer parameter identifying
   >  the call. The result will come back through your *onActivityResult(int, int,Intent)* method.

   > When an activity exits, it can call *setResult(int)* to return data back to its parent. It must always supply a result code, which can be the standard results 
   > RESULT\_CANCELED, RESULT\_OK, or any custom values starting at RESULT\_FIRST\_USER. In addition, it can optionally return back an Intent containing any additional 
   > data it wants. All of this information appears back on the parent's Activity.onActivityResult(),along with the integer identifier it originally supplied.

   >  If a child activity fails for any reason (such as crashing), the parent activity will receive a result with the code RESULT_CANCELED.

     static final int PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST = 0;

     public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
         if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER) {
             // When the user center presses, let them pick a contact.
             startActivityForResult(
                 new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK,
                 new Uri("content://contacts")),
                 PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST);

     protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode,
             Intent data) {
         if (requestCode == PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST) {
             if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
                 // A contact was picked.  Here we will just display it
                 // to the user.
                 startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, data));
