## JSON vs XML
<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90956475/137596275-31ebec6b-fd23-4702-b2f4-6798ae4bbcde.png"></p>

**Both `JSON` and `XML` can be used to receive data from a web server.**

### JSON

`JSON` (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format and it is completely language independent. It is based on the JavaScript programming language and is easy to understand and generate.

**Basic data types supported by `JSON` are:**

* Strings
* Number
* Booleans
* Null

>Example :

```json
{"Geeks":[
    { "firstName":"Vivek", "lastName":"Kothari" },
    { "firstName":"Suraj", "lastName":"Kumar" },
    { "firstName":"John", "lastName":"Smith" },
    { "firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Gregory" }
]}
```
### XML
`XML` (Extensible markup language) was designed to carry data, not to display data. The design goals of XML focus on simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. 

> Example :

```XML
<Geeks>
    <Geek>
        <firstName>Vivek</firstName> <lastName>Kothari</lastName>
    </Geek>
    <Geek>
        <firstName>Suraj</firstName> <lastName>Kumar</lastName>
    </Geek>
    <Geek>
        <firstName>John</firstName> <lastName>Smith</lastName>
    </Geek>
    <Geek>
        <firstName>Peter</firstName> <lastName>Gregory</lastName>
    </Geek>
</Geeks>
```
### JSON and XML Similarity.

1. Both JSON and XML are "self-describing" (human-readable).

2. Both JSON and XML are hierarchical (values within values).

3. Both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages.

4. Both JSON and XML can be fetched with an XMLHttpRequest

### JSON and XML Differences.

1. JSON doesn't use an end tag.

2. JSON is shorter.

3. JSON is quicker to read and write.

4. JSON can use arrays

**The biggest difference is, XML has to be parsed with an XML parser. JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.**
