## XML in android

* **The Android platform uses `XML` files in projects for many purposes, from providing basic configuration of the application in the `Manifest File`, to using `XML` Layout Files to define the user interface.**

* **Each layout file must contain one (and only one!) root element. `Linear Layouts`, `Relative Layouts`, and `Frame Layouts` (see Root Views section below) may all be root elements. Other layouts may not be. All other `XML` elements will reside within this root object.**

> ### View & ViewGroup

A `View` is simply an object from Android's built-in View class. It represents a rectangular area of the screen, and is responsible for displaying information or content, and event handling. Text, images, and buttons are all Views in Android.

A `ViewGroup` is a subclass of View, and is essentially an 'invisible container' that holds multiple Views or ViewGroups together, and defines their layout properties.

The following three layout types may be the root element in an Android XML Layout:

* A `Linear Layout` aligns its contents into a single direction, whether vertical or horizontal.

* A `Relative Layout` displays its child content in positions relative to the parent. (ie: lining an element up to the top edge of a parent, centering it within a parent, etc.)

* A `Frame Layout` is a placeholder on a screen that can display only a single view. (For this reason, Frame Layouts should be used sparingly; usually as a placeholder for Fragments, which we will cover later.)

> Example of XML

```xml
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
              android:layout_width="match_parent"
              android:layout_height="match_parent"
              android:orientation="vertical" >
    <TextView android:id="@+id/text"
              android:layout_width="wrap_content"
              android:layout_height="wrap_content"
              android:text="Hello, I am a TextView" />
    <Button android:id="@+id/button"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:text="Hello, I am a Button" />
</LinearLayout>
```
> ### Layout Attributes

Every type of layout has attributes that define the way its elements appear. There are both common attributes that all layouts share, and attributes specific to some of the layout types listed above. The following are attributes that apply to all layouts:

* `android:id`: A unique ID that corresponds to the view.
* `android:layout_width`: The width of the layout. (required for every view)
* `android:layout_height`: The height of the layout. (required for every view)
* `android:layout_marginTop`: Extra space on the top of the layout.
* `android:layout_marginBottom`: Extra space on the bottom of the layout.
* `android:paddingTop`: Padding at the top of the view.
* `android:paddingBottom`: Padding at the bottom of the view.

> ### Targeting Views by ID / Using XML Elements in Java.

We target individual XML elements and interact with them. The following code can be used to target the example XML button:

```java
Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.search_button);
```

The `findViewById()` method can locate both `Views` and `root views`. Just notice that we're re-using the same id attribute we assigned in the `XML` to later locate this element in our Java logic.
