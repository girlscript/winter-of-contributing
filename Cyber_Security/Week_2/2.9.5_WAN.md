The study of networks as a part of the pursuit of designing better computer networks in terms of improved scalability, flexibility, reliability, security and ease of setup, configuration & management, often entails their **classification based on scale**, i.e., their actual physical or geographical span.

Multi-processor internetworks (connection of two or more networks) are categorised in the ascending order of their size as:

*- Personal Area Networks (PAN)*

*- Local Area Networks (LAN)*

*- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)*

*- Wide Area Networks (WAN)*

*- The Internet*

  

## Understanding WANs

  

### Definition

Wide Area Networks are characterized by their large geographical spread which usually **spans an entire country or even a continent**. The classification of telecommunication networks as WANs entails the **average interprocessor distance of 100-1000 km**.

  

WANs are often used as a means of interconnecting smaller Local Area Networks (LANs) together to enable internetwork communication, thus creating one composite network. However, other applications of WAN may involve the connection of individual hosts, analogous to the LANs.

  

### Components of a WAN

A WAN can be better understood as a combination of:

  

&nbsp;**1. end devices or hosts** which serve as the *Customer Premise Equipment (CPE)*, which are connected by a separate

&nbsp;**2. communication subnet** or simply a **subnet**,

whose role is to transfer messages from hosts to hosts or between the connected networks.

  

Oftentimes, the host devices and the subnet differ in terms of ownership as well. For instance, while the host devices such as the desktop computers of a CISCO office branch in Gurgaon are managed by the assigned employees, the management of the subnet connecting the computer network to that of the Pune branch may either be designated to the IT department of the company or maybe handled by the network telecommunication service provider.

  

In most WANs, this subnet is composed of two distinct elements:

&nbsp; **i. transmission lines** (wired: copper, optical fibres or wireless: radio links) whose purpose is to move the message bits amongst machines and the

&nbsp; **ii. switching media/edge devices** (such as Routers, Modems, Multiplexers, WAN switches etc.) that are switching computers connecting the transmission lines and relaying the messages to intended receiver machines.

  

### Varieties of WAN

Traditionally, there are two primary types of Wide Area Networks:

First are the ones that **leverage the services & the underlying capacity of the Internet** to establish connections between the CPEs, through the utilization of an arrangement known as the **Virtual Private Network or VPN**.

Another type of WAN achieves network connectivity and communication through the **establishment of physical, dedicated links** amongst the constituting LANs or hosts, which are managed & overseen by the network service providers (referred to as subnet managers in this context). These subnet managers also provide connectivity of these individual LANs to other networks which are a part of the Internet, and are thus known as the **Internet Service Providers (ISP)**.
Site-to-site VPN grants several added benefits:
-  *Lower traffic latency* by routing the packets through an isolated virtual connection, instead of using the public Internet.
- Great ease in *network scalability*. A site-to-site VPN only requires a VPN gateway at each location, making it hassle-free to add a new site or another office branch to the network or even relocate a remote office or site.
- End-to-encryption via VPN tunnelling to allow packet security during transit.


Another variety of WAN is characterized by the employment of wireless technologies to enable data transmission.

e.g.: Satellite systems communicating with computers stationed on Earth, Cellular Telephone Networks etc.

  

## Security Challenges

Due to their large scale and thus added layers of complexity, Wide Area Networks have historically faced several notable challenges in terms of network security:

  

1. The existing vulnerabilities in the accompanying hardware and software, especially the legacy systems, used as a part of the network, pose an added level of security threat.
e.g.: An issue in the XML parser of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) firewalls as a consequence of a software fix, was leveraged by attackers to compromise the network.

  

2. Management of network traffic flowing through a large number of paths and traffic policing to judge which packets to allow and which to discard, in an attempt of protecting the network from potential attacks, close monitoring is demanded. The ability to integrate learned decision-making regarding traffic steering without compromising the security aspect of it continues to serve as a quandary.

  

3. Incorporation of multi-tenancy (mode of operation of software where multiple independent instances of one or multiple applications operate in a shared environment) to enable the partitioning of the network is required for efficient security management through the implementation of the CIA principles. This allows room for micro-segment isolation with data confinement, separating guest networks from the core.

  

4. Since Internet WAN links are highly prone to attacks, particularly Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, in an unfortunate scenario of system compromise, if one link goes down, the entire connected LAN bears the brunt through disconnected communication.
