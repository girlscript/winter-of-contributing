# OSI MODEL

An **ISO** (International Organisation for Standardisation) standard covers all aspects of network communication is an **OSI model**.<br>
**OSI** stands for **Open System Interconnection** model, and it was first established in 1970.<br>
<br>

An open system is a **set of protocols** which allows any of the two different systems to communicate with each other, it is not protocol, 
it is set of protocol for which we gave term
'model', whose work is to understand and design network architechture, which is flexible and robust.<br>

It's main aim is to facilitate communication between different systems without changing the logic of hardware or software.<br>
It is intended to be the basis for the creation of protocols in OSI stack.<br>

OSI model is a layered framework for the design of network systems which allows communication between every type of computer systems.<br>
It consist of 7 seperate layer, and each layer is related to each other in some or the other way and defines the process of moving infomation across a network.<br>

## OSI LAYER :
An OSI model consist of 7 layers named:<br>
-LAYER 7: ``Application layer`` <br>
-LAYER 6: ``Presentation layer`` <br>
-LAYER 5: ``Session layer`` <br>
-LAYER 4: ``Transport layer`` <br>
-LAYER 3: ``Network layer`` <br>
-LAYER 2: ``Data link layer`` <br>
-LAYER 1: ``Physical layer`` <br>

## WORK OF OSI LAYERS:

### LAYER 7: APPLICATION LAYER
Application layer is the last and seventh layer of the OSI Model. 
This layer is abstraction layer and handles sharing protocols over the computer network with OSI and TCP/IP suite.

### LAYER 6: PRESENTATION LAYER
This is the sixth layer of osi model and is also called translation layer because this layer is used to present data to the application

### LAYER 5: SESSION LAYER
This is the fifth layer of osi model and this layer manages sessions between end user application process

### LAYER 4: TRANSPORT LAYER
This is the fourth layer of osi model. This layer transports message from one process to another process.
It takes data from the network layer and transmits data to  application layer. 
This layer acknowledges data transmission and resides on the operating system of the device and works with the system calls.

### LAYER 3: NETWORK LAYER
This is the third layer of osi model. It's work is to deliver the individual packets from the source node to the destination node and sends data from one network to another. 
It makes use of different routing algorithms to send data and carries an IP address at the header.

### LAYER 2: DATA LINK LAYER
This is the second layer of osi model. This layer's duty is to move frames from one node to the other node and  
makes sure that data received or transferred should be error-free and ensures security.

### LAYER 1: PHYSICAL LAYER
This is the first layer of osi model. This layer works for the sending of individual bits from 
one node to another node and is responsible for the connection between two devices.Every data of this layer is converted in binary format and after converting it, 
the data is send to the data link layer.

```And this was all about OSI model and layers.```
