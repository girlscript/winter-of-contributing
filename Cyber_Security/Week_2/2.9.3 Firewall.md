# **FIREWALL**

The term firewall originally referred to a fireproof wall, usually made of stone or metal that prevented flames from spreading to connected structures. Later the term was adapted for use with computer networks: **A firewall prevents undesirable traffic from entering protected areas of the network.**

A firewall is one of the most effective security tools available for protecting internal network users from external threats. A firewall is usually installed between two or more networks and controls the traffic between them as well as helps prevent unauthorized access. Firewall products use various techniques for determining what is permitted or denied access to a network.

Generally, it monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on defined set of rules it **accepts** (allow the packet), **drops** (block the packet with no reply) or **rejects** (block the packet with a reply *“unreachable”*) the data packets.

## **Firewall can be implemented in two ways:** 

1.	Hardware Based
2.	Software Based 


## **Hardware based Firewall:**

- A hardware firewall is a freestanding unit that does not use the resources of the computers it is protecting, so there is no impact on processing performance.
- It does not operate on the system, it is incorporated into the router, situated between the computer and the internet gateway and protects a whole network at a time.
- Configuration is not so easy and it is not as flexible as compared with Software based firewall.
  

## **Software based Firewall:**

- Firewalls implemented in software is to be loaded onto PCs, networking devices, or servers.
- It operates on the system and protects one system at a time.
- Configuration is easy and it is flexible (can choose which application has to be installed) but expensive.


## **Uses of a Firewall:**

There are many uses of Firewall:
- It prevents unauthorized remote access and remote control of a computer, for evil purposes.
- Data security is ensured, based on IP address and protocol.
- It prevents from ransomware, malware, and phishing attacks.
- It blocks destructive, unsuitable or pornographic content.
- It ensures continuity of operations as well as availability of information.
- It can shield older PCs with earlier versions of Operating Systems.
- It is safer for online gamers as well.


## **Advantages of Firewall:**

- A Firewall prevents hackers and remote access.
- It protects data.
- It ensures better privacy and security.
- It protects from Trojans.
- A network-based Firewall (like a router) can offer protection to multiple systems where as an OS-based Firewall can only protect individual systems.


## **Disadvantages of Firewall:**

- Expensive: Implementation of hardware-based firewall can be costly (depending on the sophistication of the network).
-  Decreased Performance: Performance is affected as each packet has to be checked for the verification before going in to the network.
- Blocking legitimate processes: For example, Messaging process which is required by the user can be blocked by the firewall.
- Firewall maintenance and up-gradation require extra manpower and resources.
