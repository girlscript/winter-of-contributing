# Routers

Routers are networking devices that operate at the OSI model's layer 3 or network layer. They are in charge of receiving, analysing, and forwarding data packets between computer networks that are connected. When a data packet comes, the router looks at the destination address, examines its routing tables to determine the best route, and then sends the packet down that path.A router is a device that connects many devices to the Internet and allows them to communicate with one another. Routers can also be used to set up local networks of devices. If you wish to share files between devices or allow staff to share software tools, these local networks are useful.

## Features of Router
1. A router is a network layer or layer 3 device.

2. It joins multiple networks and transfers data packets from one to the other.

3. IP packets are used to send and receive data. It employs the IP address that is specified in the IP packet's destination field to transfer data.

4. Broadcast storms can be avoided with the use of routers.

5. Routers are more expensive than hubs, bridges, and switches, which are all networking devices.


## Types of Routers

- __Wireless Routers__ - They have a WiFi connection available. Laptops, smartphones, and other WiFi-enabled devices In addition, they can provide normal Ethernet routing.

- __Broadband Routers__ - They are used to connect to the Internet via telephone and to provide high-speed Internet access via voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology. The Internet Service Provider configures and provides them (ISP).

- __Core Routers__ - They can only route data packets within a single network. They create the backbone of a network by connecting all of the devices within it. ISPs and communication interfaces both make use of it.
