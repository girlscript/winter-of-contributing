Just like our houses need to be designated addresses to help in their unique identification on the globe, hosts & other device interfaces on a computer network require a certain set of unique addresses to help distinguish them over the other several networks that they might need to communicate with, spread across regions. 
For such purposes, **Internet Protocol addressing**, or **IP addressing** comes to our aid in serving as that unique ID and to assist with location addressing.

## Introduction
### The Internet Protocol
Analogous to human conversations which demands the incorporation of a certain set of rules to be followed during a dialogue- for instance, the language of conversation is mutually decided upon by the communicating parties as Tagalog, the medium of transmission as postal letters etc.- thus ensuring the proper & correct transmission of thoughts without undue misinterpretations, communication through the exchange of data over a network too requires such set of guidelines, mutually agreed upon, and formally known as ***protocols***.

While there exist a plethora of such **network protocols**, serving various purposes, the **Internet Protocol (IP)**, assists in the communication & routing of the data across one or more computer networks- most notable being the Internet- by providing several provisions, one of the most essential of which is the concept of **IP addresses**.

## Knowing your IPs
Formally, the **Inter Protocol (IP)** addresses are **logical network addresses** represented by a **string of numbers** which serves as a **unique, distinguishing numerical label** for a computer host or any device with a designated interface (such as an installed Network Interface Card (NIC)), connected over a computer network, **enabling them to communicate locally as well as remotely**.
Every packet sent across a local network or the Internet contains a source and a destination IP address of the original sender and the ultimate receiver, thus allowing the intermediary networking devices to ensure that the **information gets to the intended destination** and any **replies can be correctly directed to the source** of the message.

Depending on the scope of the network and the type of device, the IPv4 address is either globally or locally unique. Devices that are visible to users outside their local network (e.g.: webservers, fileservers etc.) must have a **globally unique IP address**. Devices with visibility restricted to within their local networks possess a **locally unique IP address**.


## IPv4 addresses
The **Internet Protocol ver. 4** or **IPv4 addresses** are represented as strings of **32 binary bits** (made up of 0s & 1s), thus creating a seemingly large, yet quite limiting address pool of over 4 billion IPv4 addresses.
To facilitate its readability, these painstakingly long sequences of **32 binary bits are clubbed into 4 groups of 8** (known as octets) bits, separated by 'dots(.)', with each octet presented as its decimal equivalent. This popular representation is known as the **dotted-decimal notation**. 
Thus, each of the octets can have a value ranging from **0-255** in decimal notation, and **00000000-11111111** in binary notation.

## Features of IPv4 addresses

### The Hierarchal Address Structure
The overall 4 sets of octets can be classified into two primary parts:
**1. Network prefix**: Depending upon the type of the IPv4 address and the correspondingly permitted size of the network, a few of the 4 octets are shared among the various hosts & interfaced devices present on the same network. These sets of octets are known as the **network prefixes** and allow various interconnected networks to be distinguished from each other.

**2.** **Host number**: This is the octet(s) that is unique to the various hosts & interfaced devices present on the same network, facilitating the distinction of these end-devices from one other.

### Types of IPv4 addresses

*A. <u>Based on the scope of the local network:*
&emsp; &emsp; <br>**1. Private Addresses**: They are characterized as the set of addresses reserved out of the IPv4 address pool, meant only to be used for the identification of end-devices on a local, private network.

Specifically, the private address blocks are:

-   **10.0.0.0 /8**  or  **10.0.0.0**  to  **10.255.255.255**
-   **172.16.0.0 /12**  or  **172.16.0.0**  to  **172.31.255.255**
-   **192.168.0.0 /16**  or  **192.168.0.0**  to  **192.168.255.255**

It is important to know that the addresses within these blocks are not allowed on the internet and all messages originating from them must be filtered out or discarded by internet routers.
Due to their restrictions on the scope of use, they allow the provision of being **reused on different private networks**, without the usually incurred penalties.

&emsp; &emsp; <br> **2. Public Addresses:** These type of addresses encompasses all the addresses which are not in the private address pool and can be globally routed between the ISP (internet service provider) routers.
However, since a public IP address is a unique identifier for each device connected to the internet, it must be unique.

*B.  Based on the mode of address configuration:*
&emsp; &emsp; <br> **1. Static Addresses:** Configured manually, static IP addresses are not subject to change upon configuration until the device is decommissioned or the network architecture changes. They are usually used by servers and other such network components which require a fixed address to enable communication.

&emsp; &emsp; <br> **2. Dynamic Addresses:** Intuitively, Dynamic IP addresses are configured dynamically, on the fly, by the assistance of Dynamic Host Resolution Protocol (DHCP), and is therefore subject to frequent change.
They are **only active for a certain amount of time**, after which they expire, thus forcing the device to either request for a new one or renew the lease with the DHCP server.
Due to their contingent nature, dynamic addressing provides a better sense of security against address trackability.
 
*C. <u> Based on the scope of the generated messages and the intended number of receiver interfaces:*</u>
&emsp; &emsp; <br> **1. Unicast Addresses:**
When a device sends a packet to a unicast address, the packet is simply routed to only the intended receiver device, denoted by the unique IP destination address, as specified in the IP datagram (i.e., the format of data that can be recognized by the Internet Protocol).

&emsp; &emsp; <br> **2. Broadcast Addresses:** The broadcast address is used when a message is intended to be relayed to all the devices present on the local network. Broadcast may be **directed** or **limited**. **A directed broadcast is meant to be relayed to all the hosts present on a specific network**. For example, a host on the 192.168.50.0/24 network sends a packet to 192.168.50.255. 
On the other hand, **A limited broadcast is sent to 255.255.255.255**. 

&emsp; &emsp; <br> **3. Multicast Addresses:** These reserved sets of addresses are used to relay a packet sent across the network to only a specific group of users which have subscribed to the multicast group.
IPv4 has reserved the **224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255** addresses as a **multicast range**. The addresses **224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255** are restricted to engage in **multicasting communication over the local network only**.

### IPv4 Network Design & Architectures
For several reasons- like simplification of the network to facilitate ease of its physical setup & future expansion as well as its configuration, management and troubleshooting- large networks are often chosen to be divided into smaller, more manageable **subnetworks**.

A term known as **subnet mask** is defined when discussing IPv4 addressing, which refers to the 32-bit notation for the physical network that the devices are a part of and enables the determination of both the size of the network as well as the network prefix for the participating devices.

On the similar lines of thinking, <u>**Classful network architecture**</u> was introduced in 1981 to enable fine-network management and deal with problems regarding network isolation, whereby the values of the first three, most significant bits of the IPv4 address representation were employed to divide the available address space into several classes, viz., A, B, C, D & E.

**1. Class A**: 
- Characterized by the dedication of the **first octet for the representation of the network prefix**.
- Subnet mask: 255.0.0.0
- Address Range: 1.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255
- With an address space of more than 65,536, Class A representation was used for the configuration of networks with a large number of end devices.

**2. Class B:**
- The first two octets are used to denote the network prefix
- Address Range: 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255
- Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0

**3. Class C:**
- The first three octets are reserved for the network prefix of the address.
- Address Range: 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
- Class C addresses were dedicated for the configuration for home or SOHO (small-office, home-office) networks with less than 254 hosts.

**4. Class D:** 
- This class represents the addresses uniquely allocated for the multicast groups
- Address Range: 224.0. 0.0 â€“ 239.255. 255.255 

**5. Class E:**
- Encompassing the addresses from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255, class E was reserved for research purposes and was never opened for outspread use.

While Classful network architecture presented a compelling case of allowing more controlled network management & configuration, it lacked scalability and thus could not support network expansion.
Therefore, a new system of <u>**Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)**</u> was introduced for address space management. As Classful network design grew obsolete and fell out of wide use, CIDR, in practice, posed very few restrictions on the address space in use by introducing a concept of **variable-length subnet masking (VLSM)** to allow address allocation and network routing based on arbitrary-length prefixes.

## Rise of The Messiah: The Introduction of Internet Protocol Version 6
### IPv4 Address Pool Exhaustion
The IP addressing is managed by The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) which allocates pools of IP addresses to bodies called the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). These organizations in turn are responsible for the distribution of the allocated IP addresses to the Internet Service Providers (ISP), which further enable the IP configuration of organizational & home networks.

Despite several changes made throughout the 90s to accommodate the rapid expansion of the Internet in that era and thus the explosive proliferation of the devices now connecting to the internet, IANA failed to establish scalability with the restrictedly insufficient available pool of IPv4 addresses, and the RIRs soon ran out of their allocated pools.

### Motivation For A Better Alternative
Under the pressure of the address crisis, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)- an organization whose primary objective is to oversee standard development especially pertaining to the Internet protocol suite- found a golden opportunity to create an alternative that not only allowed flexibility in terms of network scalability with a larger address pool but also overcame the existing shortcomings of the current Internet Protocol Version 4. Hence, came the prodigal successor: Internet Protocol Version 6.



## Understanding IP Version 6 (IPv6)
Designed to overcome the chief shortcoming of a highly limited address space provided by its predecessor Internet Protocol Version 4, Internet Protocol Version 6 addresses are **represented by a string of 128-bits**, providing a massive **address pool of more than 340 undecillion addresses** (that's 36 trailing zeroes right there!) along with an abundant scope of further expansion.
To improve the readability of the IPv6 addresses, these 128 binary bits are **clubbed into groups of 16 (known as hextets)** and are represented in their **hexadecimal equivalent**. Thus, every 4 bits is represented by a single hexadecimal digit for a total of 32 hexadecimal values.

### Compressing IPv6 Addresses
There are two thumb rules followed to reduce the overall size of an IPv6 address:

1. Omit the leading zeros in all of the 8 segments individually.
2. Omit one (and only one) "consecutively all-zero" segment & replace it with a double colon (::).

<u>*Example of IPv6 Address Compression*:

| Fully Expanded| 		2001:0DB8:0000:1111:0000:0000:0000:0200    | 
| :---        |    :----:   |      
| Removal of Leading Zeroes   | 2001:DB8:0:1111:0:0:0:200       | 
|Compressed|2001:DB8:0:1111::200|


## Features of IPv6 addresses

### The Address Structure 
- The 3 leftmost hextets (48-bits) denote the <u>**global routing prefix**</u> which represents the *public topology* and it serves the purpose of network identification, equivalent to subnet masks in IPv4 addressing. It is usually provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP).
- The next hextet (16-bits) are referred to as <u>**subnet ID**</u> used to identify networks inside of the local enterprise site
- The least significant 48 bits or the last 3 hextets represent the <u>**interface ID**</u> which is used to uniquely identify the device interface/host.

### The Types of IPv6 Addresses
Analogous to IPv4 addresses, Ipv6 address space is also categorized based on the scope of the message and the intended number of receiver interfaces. But unlike its predecessor, **IPv6 does not support broadcasting** and instead utilizes the assistance of multicasting to achieve the results. Additionally, it defines a new type of address, viz., **anycast**.
 
&emsp; &emsp; **1. Unicast Addresses:** In the IPv6 implementation, the following types of unicast addresses are available for use:

-   *Global unicast addresses*: These addresses enjoy a global scope and essentially serve the same purposes as IPv4 public addresses and are thus routable on the Internet.
    
-   *Link-local IPv6 addresses*: They enable communication between neighbouring hosts that reside on the same network. With a local scope, they cannot be used outside the link. 
Link-local IPv6 addresses are characterized by the possession of the **prefix FE80::/10**.
    
-   *Loopback IPv6 address*: The addresses meant to be used on loopback interfaces (virtual network interfaces used to check if a device is up & online). 
The IPv6 loopback address is **0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1**, which can be denoted as **::1/128** (using address compression).
    
-   *Unspecified address*: Indicating the absence of an address, it is often used for an IPv6 host that does not yet have an address assigned to it.
The IPv6 unspecified address is denoted by 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0, which can be represented as ::/128.

&emsp; &emsp; **2. Multicast Addresses:** Multicast addresses support 16 different types of address scopes, including *node, link, site, organization,* and *global scope*. The variance of the 4-bit prefix field is used to distinguish the various address scopes.
The following types of multicast addresses can be used in an IPv6 subscriber access network:

-   *Solicited-node multicast address*: Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages (used to determine the link-layer unicast address of the neighbouring devices) are relayed to this type of multicast address.
-   *Well-known multicast addresses*: These addresses are closest to our existing understanding of multicast addressing are used to communicate to an assigned group of devices on the network

&emsp; &emsp; **3. Anycast Addresses:** A packet destined for an anycast address is transmitted to only one of the interfaces (the "nearest" one according to the router's routing table) associated with that address, & not to all.

## Amicable Co-Existence
It is important to note that while efforts are being continually put to enable a full transition from IPv4 to IPv6, with an objective of complete dismissal of Internet Protocol Version 4 from general practice, it is estimated to entail decades to come to finally witness the desired results and cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, various provisions have been put into place by the IETF to allow communication between devices despite the differences in protocols they follow, some of which include:
**1. Dual Stack:** It allows the simultaneous existence of both IPv4 & IPv6 as a part of the same network, by arranging the provision for running both the protocol stacks.
**2. Tunnelling:** It is a method of transporting an IPv6 packet over an IPv4 network, by encapsulating the IPv6 packet inside an IPv4 packet.
**3. Translation:** Network Address Translation 64 (NAT64) allows IPv6-enabled devices to communicate with IPv4-enabled devices by enabling the translation from one type of packet to another.
