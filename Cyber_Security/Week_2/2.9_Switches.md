# Network Switches
Popularly known as a switch, a network switch or a *MAC bridge*, is a multiport, networking device which connects multiple devices of diverse nature such as wireless access points, printers, computers and servers, across a computer network, to enable transmission of data in the form of data packets (i.e., formatted data unit consisting of control and user information).

Operating as a Layer-2 (data link layer) device of the OSI Reference model, their primary task is to relay message packets across the network to the intended destination host, determined on the basis of the MAC (Media Access Controller) address or the physical address of the specified receiver.

## Method of Operation
Ethernet switches maintain a MAC table, in which the entries correspond to the mapping of the MAC address of the connected devices to the port identifier through which they are connected to the switch. These mappings in the MAC table are referenced to determine which host to relay the packets.

When a unicast message is generated from one of the hosts of the network, one of the following possibilities occur:

1. If the switch is newly installed with an empty MAC table, then upon receiving the packet, it relays the message packet to all the devices connected to its various ports. This phenomenon is known as **unicast flooding**. 
With each packet received by the switch to transmit forward to the intended destination, it is able to populate its MAC table by storing the mapping of the port id and the MAC address of the sending host, so that whenever the said sending device becomes the destination for some message in the future, the unicast packet can be directly relayed to it.

2. With an established switch, possesing a MAC table having all the possible mappings of port IDs to the corresponding MAC addresses of the connected devices, the message packet is simply sent accross to the intended destination by reading the destination MAC address in the Ethernet frame header and referencing its corresponding mapping from the MAC table. 


Another scenario that warrants unicast flooding is when the MAC table of the switch becomes full, but the switch is unable to find the required mapping in its table for the received packet's destination, thereby compelling it to relay the message to all the ports or *flood* all the ports.



## Types of Switches

1. **Unmanaged Switches**
Unmanaged switches do not require any configurations at the time of installation, and thus do not possess any functionalities for the same. For operation, they require only the establishment of physical connections through plugging of wires and are suitable for small office/home office networks due to their inexpensive nature.

2. **Managed Switches**
A step of improvement from their unmanaged counterparts, managed switches facilitate modification of the operations of switching by providing several provisions to perform the necessary configurations: 
<br> &emsp; -  A Command Line Interface (CLI) accessible via telnet, or secure shell, 
<br> &emsp; - embedded SNMP (Simple Network Monitoring Protocol) to enable remote device management,
<br> &emsp; - or, a web interface for web-based management.

This granted customizability in managed switches helps guarantee a better quality of services and security, with improved connectivity.

## Additional Features of Switches
1. Two kinds of interfaces can be established in a switch:
<br> &emsp; - an **access interface/port** possessing the connection to the workstations and other devices, and
<br> &emsp; - a **trunk interface** for connecting two switches together.

2. Connecting devices to network switches allows the establishment of **Virtual LANs (VLANs)**, which are basically partitioned broadcast domains isolated in a computer network at the data link layer.

3. Managed switches provide the provision of **MAC address filtering**, enabling which the maps specific MAC addresses to specific ports, thereby 'white-listingâ€™ and creating an approved list of the said addresses. This simultaneously improves the protection against malicious MAC table flooding attacks by addresses from unwanted message packets, by enabling the rejection of addresses not in the approved list, and thus 'black-listing' them.
This can be implemented on a physical port on a Cisco switch by securing it with the execution of the command with the approved MAC addresses (represented as *XXXX.XXXX.XXXX*):
 ```console
 (config-if) switchport port-security mac-address XXXX.XXXX.XXXX
 ```

4. Through the incorporation of Power over Ethernet(PoE) (a technology which enables the transmission of electrical power over the network cables), modern switches are able to eliminate the need to connect additional devices such as VoIP (Voice Over IP) phone or wireless access point to configure a separate power supply. 

## Perspective of Security
- It is difficult to implement traffic monitoring on networks constituted by devices connected via switches as the flowing traffic can only be seen at the sender and receiver ports. Additional features which are available to enable network analysis through traffic monitoring in such networks are usually not present in consumer-grade switches.

- With trunk interfaces, a switch performs auto-configuration upon detection. The Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) used by most of the switches, which enables this auto-configuration, does not implement any form of authentication to verify if the trunk negotiation sent to the switch (for the establishment of the trunk interface) was actually sent from a valid device or not.
Therefore, if an attacker is able to connect to the network under the disguise of a trunk interface by relaying a spoof trunk negotiation, they will be able to gain unauthorized entry into the VLAN.
