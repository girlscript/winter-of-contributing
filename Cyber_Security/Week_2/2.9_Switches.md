A switch is a hardware device designed to protect computers, laptops, smartphones and similar devices from unauthorized access or operation, distinct from a virtual security switch which offers software protection. Security switches should be operated by an authorized user only; for this reason, it should be isolated from other devices in order to prevent unauthorized access and it should not be possible to bypass it, in order to prevent malicious manipulation.

The primary purpose of a security switch is to provide protection against surveillance, eavesdropping, malware, spyware, and theft of digital devices.

Unlike other protections or techniques, a security switch can provide protection even if security has already been breached, since it does not have any access from other components and is not accessible by software. It can additionally disconnect or block peripheral devices, and perform "man in the middle" operations.

A security switch can be used for human presence detection since it can only be initiated by a human operator. it can also be used as a firewall.

# What Does Switch Mean?

A switch, in the context of networking, is a high-speed device that receives incoming data packets and redirects them to their destination on a local area network (LAN).

A LAN switch operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) or the network layer of the OSI Model and, as such it can support all types of packet protocols. The layer 2 switch is also sometimes called a bridge: its function is to send frames containing data packets between nodes or segments of a network.

Essentially, switches are the traffic cops of a simple local area network. Switching establishes the trajectory for the frames as the data units, and how the data moves from one area of a network to another.

By contrast, routing takes place at layer 3, there data gets sent between networks or from one network to another.

# Switching Basics for Cyber and Network Security

Network switches are used to connect computers and servers into a single network. The switch performs the function of a controller and allows the devices within a network to communicate with each other. This action is performed through packet switching, where data is received, processed and forwarded to its destination from one computer to another. Information sharing as well as resource allocation through switching allows businesses to save money while improving productivity.

# How Does a Switch Work?

Switches are key building blocks for any network. They connect multiple devices, such as computers, wireless access points, printers, and servers; on the same network within a building or campus. A switch enables connected devices to share information and talk to each other.

## Unmanaged switches

An unmanaged network switch is designed so that you can simply plug them in and they work, no configuration required. Unmanaged switches are typically for basic connectivity. You'll often see them used in home networks or wherever a few more ports are needed, such as at your desk, in a lab, or in a conference room.

 ## Managed switches
 
 Managed switches give you greater security and more features and flexibility because you can configure them to custom-fit your network. With this greater control, you can better protect your network and improve the quality of service for those who access the network.
 
 ## Network hubs and switches
 
 A network hub is a central connection point for devices in a local area network, or LAN. But there's a limit to the amount of bandwidth users can share on a hub-based network. The more devices are added to the network hub, the longer it takes data to reach its destination. A switch avoids these and other limitations of network hubs.

A large network may include multiple switches, which connect different groups of computer systems together. These switches are typically connected to a router that allows connected devices to access the Internet.

## What is a router and how does it work in a network?

While switches allow different devices on a network to communicate, routers allow different networks to communicate.

A router is a networking device that routes data packets between computer networks. A router can connect networked computers to the Internet, so multiple users can share a connection. Routers help connect networks within an organization or connect the networks of multiple branch locations. And a router works as a dispatcher. It directs data traffic, choosing the best route for information to travel across the network, so that it's transmitted as efficiently as possible.

## How to setup a network switch with a router?

You may find that you need to increase the number of ports that can plug into your router, so you can setup a network switch to connect with your router. Your network switch connects to the router through one of the ports on the router, extending the number of devices in your small office network, such as desktop computers, printers, laptops, etc. that have a wired connection to the internet.
