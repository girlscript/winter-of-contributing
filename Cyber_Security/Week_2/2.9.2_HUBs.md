# HUBS
Hub or repeater or network hub is a device which operates in physical layer and  is the most basic networking device that connects multiple devices together, and 
works as a central connection for all the devices that are connected through a hub. <br>

Hub doesn't have link layer address and they don't check link layer address of the received frame.<br>

A network hub don't have routing tables unlike router or switches or any kind of intelligence, also it doesn't have IP address.
Most of the hubs can detect basic network errors.<br>
Hubs have many ports, seperated by segment wise.

## TYPES OF HUB:
There are mainly three types of hub:<br>

- ``Passive Hub``
- ``Active Hub``
- ``Intelligent Hub``

### PASSIVE HUB
They're connection point for wires which helps to make the physical network and is capable of determining the bugs and faulty hardware. <br>
It's main objective is to accept packets over a port and circulate it to every ports. <br>
Passive hub includes ``connectors``, connector is connected to  **local area network(LAN)** .

### ACTIVE HUB
Active hub is modified version of passive hub which can also monitor the data sent to the connected devices. <br>
It also checks which data is to be sent and decides which packet to send first and as the ability to fix the damaged packets when packets are sending.<br>
It can powerup signal if any connecting device is not working in the network and helps to make the continuity of services in LAN.

### INTELLIGENT HUB
This hub is a bit more modified and intelligent version of passive and active hub.<br>
These hubs consist of management software which help to analyze the problem in the network and resolve them.<br>
It gives much better performance for the local area network, further on it can easily detect the problems.
