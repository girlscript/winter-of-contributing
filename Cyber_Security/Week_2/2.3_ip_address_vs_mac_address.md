| IP Address                                                                           | MAC Address                                                  |

| IP Address is either an IPv4 32 bits (4 bytes) or eIPv6 128 bit (16 bytes) address.  | MAC Address is a 48 bits (6 bytes) hexadecimal address.      |
| IP addresses are assigned to each device on the network                              | MAC addresses are Unique Identifier                          |
| An IP address is assigned by ISP or Admin                                            | It assigned to Network Interface Card (NIC) by Manufacturers |

| IP Addresses operate in the network layer                                            | MAC addresses operate in the data link layer                 |
| IP addresses are easy to find                                                        | MAC addresses are not easy to find                           |
| IP helps to identify the connection of the device                                    | MAC address helps to identify the device                     |
| An IP address is flexible in nature, it changes from network to network              | MAC address is not flexible it is unchangeable               |
| An IP address can be used for Multicasting or Broadcasting                           | MAC address can be used for broadcasting                     |
| IP address uses subnetting.                                                          | MAC address does not use subnetting.                         |
| IP addresses are separated by dots and colons                                        | MAC addresses are separated by colons and hyphens            |
| Example: IPv4 192.168.1.1   , IPv6  FFFF:F200:3204:0B00                               | Example: 00:FF:FF:AB:BB:AA    ,   00-FF-FF-AB-BB-AA           |
