# What is a Macro Virus? 
A Macro virus may be a bug written within the same macro language because the computer code it infects — common victims embody Microsoft stand out and Word. as a result of they aim computer code instead of systems, macro viruses will infect any software. Thus a macro virus will infect a laptop or macintosh. It’s known as a macro virus as a result of it’s written employing a macro language. A macro language may be a special-purpose search language that permits you to simply automatize sure sequences in specific applications. Normally, this helps computer code like Microsoft Word or stand out run a lot of swimmingly, since simply many keystrokes can trigger an entire series of actions. Macro viruses specifically target this macro language and insert themselves into the machine-driven processes. computer code infected with a macro virus could also be compelled to form new files, corrupt information, move text, send files, format onerous drives, insert footage, and deliver alternative, probably even a lot of harmful forms of viruses or alternative forms of malware. 

## How will a macro virus work? 
Macro viruses work by embedding malicious code into information files, like documents and spreadsheets. This code is activated as shortly as these files are opened or once macros are enabled, continuing to infect alternative files on your device. Microsoft Word documents are common carriers of macro viruses. Because of macro viruses, programs like Microsoft Word and stand out currently keep macros disabled by default. If you transfer a malicious attachment, it'll prompt you to alter macros. Doing thus triggers the payload of the virus. Macro viruses are unfold through shared networks or discs, or once they get downloaded and opened via electronic equipment or internet/intranet connections. 

## How to stop AN attack 
Because Microsoft Word and stand out currently disable macros mechanically, you always have to be compelled to alter macros to trigger the virus. meaning you'll simply avoid macro viruses by not facultative macros. If you receive a document or computer program that prompts you to run macros, don’t directly have it away. raise the one that sent you the file if macros are actually required before you are doing something.
