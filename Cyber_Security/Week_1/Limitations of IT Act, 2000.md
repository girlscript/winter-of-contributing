    The Act provides legal verification for digital signatures and
    considers contracts/documents made through electronic channels as
    valid, but the act is not applicable for some of the documents which
    include:

    1.  Execution of Power of Attorney
    2.  Execution of a Will
    3.  Contract for the sale of conveyance of immovable property
-   **Related to Cyber Crimes**

    ### Spamming

    There is no section inside the law that deals with spamming.
    Spamming is sending out emails/messages in bulk to many users. Not
    only spam messages are irritating but these messages might cause
    serious problems if they contained some malicious links to download
    malware in the user's system.

    ### Identity Theft

    Identity theft is gathering someone's private and personal
    information illegally. This can give attackers a chance to threaten
    and take ransoms from the victims or even worse can publicly reveal
    that information. The IT Act fails to cover this topic.

    ### Phishing

    Phishing is the method where an attacker disguises himself/herself
    as a trustworthy entity and steals information out of the victim.
    This can be done in various ways like email phishing, spear
    phishing, etc. This is also a loophole in IT Act as it fails to make
    any laws regarding phishing

    ### Data Protection in Internet Banking

    Information about the customers held by banks is very confidential
    and should be protected at any cost. A lot of risks is involved in
    preventing leaks of this information. Though, the IT Act states
    about unauthorized access but it does not lay any duty upon banks to
    protect the details of customers.
