  # IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL SECURITY

### WHAT IS PHYSICAL SECURITY?

Protection of any kind of hardware, software, networks or any kind of data from any kind of actions or attacks which can cause serious damage to one, is referred to as physical security.
<br>
Some times, physical security is also referred to security of any organisation or company, to safeguard it from any kind of physical disasters or threats.

Physical attacks can break to a secure data center,sneaking into restricted areas of a building or docs. Attackers could steal or damage important IT assets to 
gain access to important terminal, steal information,or upload malware onto our systems.

### AIM OF PHYSICAL SECURITY
Physical securityâ€™s main objective is to protect from any kind of threats which may harm our physical or internal system. 

### Importance of physical security in every area:
Physical security helps to safeguard data, servers and networks.
Internal ans software damage can be stopped if there's a tight security everywhere, may it be of network or servers or pc or any kind of usb.
These are so sensitive things that once exposed to threat may lead to huge damage for anyone, may it be any person's data or may it be any company's or any organization's data.

Physical security can take many shapes and forms, and so there're many ways to stop threats which are harmful, if we just only concern about physical security.

### CONCLUSION
Physical security is usually avoided or overlooked when it comes to security because most of the companies tend to take care of technical and administrative aspects of security. 
Every kind of internal security like firewalls, or any other kind of  security measures would be useless if someone is able to break in and steal the data.

And so it is to be concerned and not be avoided, once we loose security, it lead to many threats.
Better to beware and take precautions.
