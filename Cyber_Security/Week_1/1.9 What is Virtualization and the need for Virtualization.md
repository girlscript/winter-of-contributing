## What is Virtualization
In computer use, virtualization creates a computer-generated environment that is simulated, or visual, in contrast to the physical environment. This allows organizations to separate one computer or one server into multiple virtual machines. Each virtual machine can work independently and operate different operating systems or applications while sharing the resources of a single capture machine.

## How virtualization works
Virtualization defines a technology in which an operating system, visitor operating system OS or data storage is removed from the actual basic hardware or software. The primary use of virtualization technology is server virtualization, which uses a layer of software - called a hypervisor - to mimic the underlying hardware. This usually includes CPU memory, input / output and network traffic. Hypervisors take physical resources and classify them for use by the virtual environment. They can stay on top of the OS or can be installed directly on the hardware. The latter is how most enterprises virtualize their systems.

### The virtualization process follows the steps outlined below:
1. Hypervisors separate resources from their physical environments.

2. Resources are taken and separated, as needed, from the physical environment to the various virtual areas.

3. Users of the system work and perform computations within the virtual environment.

4. When the virtual environment is active, the user or system can send a command that requires additional resources from the physical environment. In response, the hypervisor transmits the message to the main system and maintains changes. This process is really fast.

## The need for virtualization
Server virualization enables a different OS to share the same network and makes it easier to move the OS between different networks without affecting the main operating system. This allows the portability of an app.

Virtualization allows many instance of application to be created thus allowing them to scale up and down according to each need. Virtualization enables balancing of load thus allowing companies to handle higher loads.

Storage recognition enables efficient use of available resources. Allows services to be delivered over the Internet.
