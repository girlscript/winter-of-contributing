<h1 align ="center">File system</h1>
The file system type defines how a storage device is read from and written to, how much storage is available after the file system’s hierarchy is implemented, what defines a block or sector, and other things. That’s why we’ll often see an operating system report that there are only 240 GB available on your 256 GB storage device.

Windows sticks you with NTFS, Apple with HFS. Linux is a working framework that will permit you to tailor it to your needs and select which rifle system you need. A few accessible choices are ext2, ext3, ext4, btrfs, reiserfs, and several more.

<h1 align ="center">Linux File system</h1>

A Linux filesystem is an organized collection of records on a disk drive or a segment. A partition is a section of memory and contains a few detailed information. In our machine, there can be different allotments of the memory. By and large, each segment includes a file system.

Linux file system is, for the most part, a built-in layer of a Linux working framework utilized to handle storage data management. It makes a difference to organize the record on the disk storage. It oversees the file title, file size, creation date, and much more data approximately a file. If we have an unsupported file organize in our record framework, we will download software to bargain with it.

<h1 align ="center">File System Structure</h1>

Linux file system includes a hierarchal file structure because it contains a root directory and its subdirectories. We can get all other directories from the root directory. As a rule, a partition has one file system, but it may have more than one file system.

All file systems require a namespace that’s a naming and organizational strategy. The namespace characterizes the naming handle, length of the file name, or a subset of characters that we can utilize for the file name. It also represents the coherent structure of file on a memory portion, such as using catalogs to organize particular files. Once a namespace is described, a Metadata description must be defined for that specific file.

The data Structure we need should support a hierarchical directory structure; this structure will describe the available and already used disk space.

The primary two parts of the given file system together are called a Linux virtual file system. It provides us with the only set of commands for the kernel(and developers) to access the file system. This virtual system requires the particular system driver to give an interface to the file system. 

These specific drivers are the second part of the implementation.

When we install the Linux file system, it provides us with lots of file systems, namely Ext, Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, JFS, ReiserFS, XFS, btrfs, and swap.

Try and understand the each type of File system
<ol type="I">
<li><b>Ext, Ext2, Ext3 and Ext4 file system</b>

<b>EXT</b> stands for Extended File system. It was an older version which is no longer in use.

<b>Ext2</b> it helps manage 2 terabytes of data in linux file system. It is the high performance disk filesystem used by Linux forfixed disks as well as removable media

<b>Ext3</b> is developed through Ext2 and is a journaling version of the ext2 filesystem.

<b>Ext4</b> upraded version of ext3 and the fastest among all ext's. It is really compatible with SSDs and is a default file system in Linux.
<br><br>
<li><b>JFS File System</b>

JFS - Journaled File system, was developed IBM as an alternative to the ext file system.
<br><br>
<li><b>XFS File System</b>

Devloped by SGI for parallel I/O processing, it was considered as high-speed JFS.
<br><br>
<li><b>ReiserFS File System</b>

It was developed as an alternative to the Ext3 system ans was designed by Hans Reiser.
<br><br>
<li><b>Btrfs File System</b>

Its a <b> B Tree File system</b>. It is utilized for fault resistance, repair system, fun organization, broad storage setup, and more. It isn't a great suit for the production system.
<br><br>
<li><b>Swap File System</b>

The swap file system is utilized for memory paging in Linux operating system amid the system hibernation. A system that never goes in rest state is required to have swap space break even with to its Ram size.
