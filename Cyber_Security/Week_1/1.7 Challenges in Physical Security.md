### Overview of physical security

When a virus breaks in the computer, the security administrator handles the bug, removes the virus and brings the wall back to protect the system. Cybersecurity enthusiasts day in and day out protect tons of online and network services so that we can receive right information and service from the right resource, but what about physical security ?

With the advancements in the technology safeguarding buildings, preventing unauthorized access to equipment, installations and confidential documents has become a challenge in the domain of physical security. We all know that without physical security, your pile of information in high end offices, if left open there are chances for it  to be leaked, corrupted and prone to thefts & breaches. But are these the only challenges that a physical security infrastructure faces?

The clear answer to this question is NO.  So, the question still hangs in the air what are the other challenges to physical security? Let’s scavenge through what are the components of the physical security and how these components have turned out to be the biggest challenges to physical security.

* **Workforce:** The corporate mantra that goes by, _“Our people are our greatest assets”_, can be the largest challenge when people are not ready to put their lives on the line for the security of various important data equipments and buildings. This leads to the problem of **lack of staff** and **lack of trustable staff**.

* **Budgeting:** Initially when the infrastructure is designed the faults are unidentified and thus when a breakdown occurs or breach or act of vandalism takes place, it is hard for stakeholders to introduce an extra budget for the upgradation of security protocols in the middle of the year. This leads to technical disparity on the compound that might compromise the real purpose of security.

* **Upgraded Tech:** For the majority of the cases, the people patrolling the compounds for the physical security are not well versed with the upgraded technology of digital surveillance, intrusion detectors alarms etc. and this can hamper the whole idea of installing hardware security to help with better surveillance of the compound to avoid human errors.

* **Everything runs on power:**  A lot of security and surveillance devices deployed on the location are handled remotely and are connected with a single power source, so if the power source is down the devices are no good to help.

*  **Hackable Tech:** Physical security is aided by various technologies such as digital camera surveillance, IOT based solution, biometric locks etc. These technologies when deployed are not secure or if they are not monitored and maintained periodically can lead to great financial loss and data loss to the organization after the breach happens.

Thus, physical security challenegs if not addressed on time can lead to detruction of whole infrastruction, defamation of organisation and loss of confidential data of the user. Thus, it is extremely important for the organisation to have a deliberate staff and budget for the deployment of correct physical security and should have periodic monitoring for the same.
