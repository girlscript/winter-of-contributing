## What is Physical Security? 

As the name suggests, Physical security is about safeguarding the people, their property and physical assets from any action or event that could lead to a loss or damage. It provides authorization, surveillance and ways of authentication to keep unwanted people, theft, frauds and data breaches out. 

Some examples are fences, laser alarms, CCTV cameras, guards, locks, IoT based solutions, etc

## Its importance

Physical security becomes really important for an organisation or a business. Any data breach or fraud in an organisation would pay heavy on the organisation and would lead to damaged reputation leading to financial loss. Because of this there would be less number of employees willing to work in that organisation, leading to the downfall of the organisation. Hence, it is really vital for companies, businesses and organisations, however small they may be, to focus their prevention efforts on not only just cybersecurity and hacking, but also physical threats. With time and awareness it has become an important part of any security plan.

1. Deterrence - Measures that keep unwanted individuals out from space physically. For example barriers, walls, doors, etc. We can also use technology to help in this task. Access control systems and video security cameras deter unauthorized people from attempting to access the area or building. 

2. Detection - System that detects thefts or attacks. Examples: Sensors, alarms, and automatic notifications. 

3. Delay - System that slows the intruders down. Examples: Access control, like requiring a key card or mobile credential, is one method of delay. 

4. Response - These are the components that are initiated once an attack or intrusion occurs. Examples: communication systems, building lockdowns, contacting emergency services or first responders. 

5. Mitigate - Measures that maximise the protection provided at the boundary of the building or asset that is being protected.
