# Importance of Information Security? 
Before jumping to the question information security, it is important to understand cyber space.

**Cyber space** is best described as a virtual environment where you use computer network to communicate over the network. 

## Why is information security needed?


We need security to reduce the unauthorized access to our personal information such as passwords, credit/debit card details, and other important documents. For organizations, even a small breach could cost in millions.

The cyber space is evolving rapidly which brings with it both, good and bad users in the form of crackers or spams or even softwares called malwares!The use of cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services, to store sensitive data and personal information is increasing both inherent and residual risk. The chance of your company being the victim of a successful cyber attack or data breach is on the rise, thanks to widespread inadequate cloud service configuration and increasingly adept cybercriminals.

Cyber risks can originate at any level of your company. Simple social engineering scams like phishing must be taught to your employees, as well as more advanced cybersecurity threats like ransomware (think WannaCry) and other software aimed to steal intellectual property or personal data.

We all rely on the security of our personal data and information. When connecting onto an application or entering more sensitive data in digital healthcare systems, for example. Our data could slip into the wrong hands if these systems, networks, and infrastructures aren't properly protected. In this context, we're talking about technological and policy protection.

Organizations and corporations, governments, the military, and other socially critical organisations are all in the same boat. They keep massive volumes of information in data warehouses, computers, and other devices. This material contains a lot of sensitive information. In many circumstances, exposing this knowledge might be quite dangerous.

Whether you're a person, a small business, or a major corporation, you rely on computer systems on a daily basis.

Hence to protect our data and assets on an unreliable network or channel, we need the support of security.
