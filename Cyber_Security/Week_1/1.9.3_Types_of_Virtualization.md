# _______________________TYPES OF VIRTUALISATION_______________________

<!--### WHAT IS VIRTUALISATION?
Virtualisation is a process, which allows us to run the image of multiple operating systems on a physical computer.<br>
Images of operating systems are called virtual machines, and it is basically a software representation of a physical machine that can execute or perform the same 
function as of physical machine.<br>
Each virtual machine contains a seperate copy of os with its own resources.<br>

<!--### FEATURES OF VIRTUALISATION:
- `` Partitioning `` <br>
- `` Isolation ``<br>
- ``  Encapsulation``<br>
- `` Interposition ``<br>-->

There're 5 types of virtualisation, namely:
1. Server virtualisation
2. Application Virtualisation
3. Network virtualistion
4. Processor and memory virtualisation, and
5. Data and storage virtualisation.

Here's the description about ``Application Virtualisation``

<!--### 1. SERVER VIRTUALISATION

Single physical layer is partitioned into multiple virtual servers.<br>
Each virtual server has its own hardware resources like cpu, ram, network controller,hypervisor etc.<br>
Server virtualisation ensures scalability of platform as per volume of data.-->

### 2. APPLICATION VIRTUALISATION:

- Application virtualisation encapsulates applications on underlining of physical computer system.<br>
- It improves managebility and portability of an application.<br>
- This is a virtualisation layer which is inserted between an application and os.<br>
- It allows the running of legacy apps, enables cross-platform operations, prevents conflicts with other virtualized apps.<br>
- It runs software from a remote server and is able to remove software installation procedure and creates virtual software.<br>
- It reduces application conflicts and centralises application updates as a whole, in addition, it also speed ups application deployement as compared to other.<br>
- It needs no reboots and uninstallations. <br>
- It runs on both 32 and 64 bit windows plaform.<br>
- In addition this is also being hosted on cloud, like aws cloud, which means, we can access it from anywhere and from any workig device. <br>


### USE CASES AND ADVANTAGES:

- ``application virtualisation makes our work wasy by linking a file in network in the workstation. ``<br>
 - ``It gives us application mobility and Secures remote access capability  ``<br>
 - ``Makes migration and handling of software and files more easier and simplified magnification ``<br>
 - ``virtualisation of any software reduces cost and space of the real software and thus benefits us in lot of way  ``<br>
 - ``Simple installation and easy deployement also it makes portable applications which is also easier to cleanup  ``<br>
 - ``Reduced conflicts between two or more application, in addition it is easy ti rollback, and update``<br>
 - `` Independent of operating system``<br>
 - ``It gives security to the application and software``<br>

<!--### 3. NETWORK VIRTUALISATION:

It uses virtual networking as a pool of connection resources.<br>
It helps in defining different networks with different sets of performance and capacities to manage the large amount of data to be distributed.-->

<!--### 4. PROCESSOR AND MEMORY VIRTUALISATION:

It optimizes the power of processor and maximizes its performance.<br>
Memory virtualisation decouples memory from the servers<br> -->

<!--### 5. DATA AND STORAGE VIRTUALISATION:

It provides and abstract service that, delivers data continuously in a consistent form without the prior knowledge of the underlining physical data base.<br>
It provides dynamic linked data service.<br> -->
