# ðŸš€Competitive Programming
Competitive programming combines two topics:
 - Design of algorithms 
 - Implementation of algorithms.



## Design of Algorithms

The competitive programming is all about inventing efficient algorithm that can solve well-defined computational problems.The design of algorithms requires problem solving and mathematical skills. Solution to a problem is a combination of well-known methods and new insights.Mathematics plays an important role in competitive programming.


## Implementation of Algorithms

In competitive programming, the solutions to problems are evaluated by testing an implemented algorithm using a set of test cases. Thus, after coming up with an algorithm that solves the problem, the next step is to correctly implement it. Whichn is requires good programming skills.



## Some popular prograaming language

- C++
- Python
- JAVA
## Programming Contests
### IOI 
- It *International Olympiad in Informaticsis* an annual programming contest for secondary school students

### ICPC 
- It *International Collegiate Programming Contest* is an annual programming contest for university students. In ICPC consists of several stages, and finally the best teams are invited to the World Finals. In each ICPC contest, the teams have five hours of time to solve about ten algorithm problems. A solution to a problem is accepted only if it solves all test cases efficiently. During the contest, competitors may view the results of other teams, but for the last hour the scoreboard is frozen and it is not possible to see the results of the last submissions.

### Some Online Contests on website
- Codeforces
- AtCoder
- CodeChef
- CS Academy
- HackerRank
- Topcoder

### Some companies organize online contests

- Facebook Hacker Cup
- Google Code Jam
- Yandex.Algorithm

### Tips for Practicing
- When solving problems, one should keep in mind that the number of solved problems is not so important that the quality of the problems. It is tempting to select problems that look nice and easy and solve them, and skip problems that look hard and tedious. However, the way to really improve oneâ€™s skills is to focus on the latter type of problems.

- Important observation is that most programming contest problems can be solved using simple and short algorithms, but the difficult part is to invent the algorithm. Competitive programming is not about learning complex and obscure algorithms by heart, but rather about learning problem solving and ways to approach difficult problems using simple tools.
