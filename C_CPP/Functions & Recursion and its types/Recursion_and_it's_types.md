# Recursion and it's Types:
## Recursion -
- Function calling itself
- every recursive solution has an iterative solution
- Recursive function consists of two parts\
 i.e recursive case and base case.
- The base case is a piece of code that allows us to end a recursive function.
## Syntax-
void recursion ()  
{  
recursion(); // The recursive function calls itself   
}  
int main ()  
{  
recursion (); // function call  
}  
## Types of Recursion -
1. Linear 
2. Binary
3. Ternary
4. Tail
5. Exponential
