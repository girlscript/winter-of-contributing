# Rat in a Maze (Backtracking)
#### A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.

In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination. Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem. For example, a more complex version can be that the rat can move in 4 directions and a more complex version can be with a limited number of moves.

[**Backtracking Algorithm**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-algorithms/)**:**  Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally. Solving one piece at a time, and removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree) is the process of backtracking.

**Approach:** Form a recursive function, which will follow a path and check if the path reaches the destination or not. If the path does not reach the destination then backtrack and try other paths.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Create a solution matrix, initially filled with 0â€™s.
2.  Create a recursive function, which takes initial matrix, output matrix and position of rat (i, j).
3.  if the position is out of the matrix or the position is not valid then return.
4.  Mark the position output[i][j] as 1 and check if the current position is destination or not. If destination is reached print the output matrix and return.
5.  Recursively call for position (i+1, j) and (i, j+1).
6.  Unmark position (i, j), i.e output[i][j] = 0.

**Output:**  
The 1 values show the path for rat

 1  0  0  0 
 1  1  0  0 
 0  1  0  0 
 0  1  1  1

**Complexity Analysis:**

-   **Time Complexity:**  O(2^(n^2)).  
    The recursion can run upper-bound 2^(n^2) times.
-   **Space Complexity:**  O(n^2).  
    Output matrix is required so an extra space of size n*n is needed.
