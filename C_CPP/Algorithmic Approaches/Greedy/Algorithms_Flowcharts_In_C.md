### To write a program, it is necessary to follow some steps i.e ALGORITHM!üíØ

#### Lets talk about Algorithms and Flowcharts In C

### What is an Algorithm?
Algorithm refers to the **step-by-step instruction** to get the expected output.
These Algorithms are **language-independent** i.e You can write them in rough language too!


## Characteristics of an Algorithm
- Clear and Unambiguous
- Well-defined Inputs
- Well-defined Outputs
- Finite-ness
- Feasible
- Language Independent


## How To Design an Algorithm?
- Fulfilling the pre-requisites such as **constraints,input,output** and **solution** of the problem must be considered while **solving the problem**.
- Designing the algorithm using **steps** or **flowcharts**.

### Lets us consider an easy Example: Write an algorithm for measuring 4 liter of water if only 5 liter and 3 liter jugs are available.
**(Quite Tricky But Simple! Enjoy doing üëç)**

START

Step 1: Fill the 5-liter jar.

Step 2: Transfer 3 liters out of it into the 3-liter jar.

Step 3: Empty the 3-liter jar.

Step 4: Transfer the rest 2 liters left in the 5-liter jar into the 3-liter jar. 

Step 5: Refill the 5-liter jar again.

Step 6: Empty 1-liter from the 5-liter jar into 3-liter jar (which has 2 liters in it).

Step 7: Empty the 3-liter jar.

Step 8: The 5 liter jar now has 4 liters left in it.

END


**_Try to make a flowchart to simplify it followed by a code!_**

#### Now, to make a Flowchart, we need to learn some symbols too!üíØ


## What is a Flowchart?
Programmers often use it as a **program-planning tool** to solve a problem using **symbols**.
 
### Basic Symbols used in Flowchart Designs
- **_Terminal_**: The **oval symbol** denotes **Start, Stop and Halt** in a program. Terminal is the **first** and **last** symbols in the flowchart.
- **_Input/Output_**: A **parallelogram** denotes any function of input/output type.
- **_Processing_**: A **box** represents arithmetic instructions(**adding, subtracting, multiplication and division**) are indicated by **action or process symbol**.
- **_Decision_**: **Diamond** symbol represents a decision point( **yes/no**) question or (**true/false**).
- **_On-page Connector_**: Connectors are used to **avoid any confusions** and **connect pages** . It is represented by a **circle**.


## An example of a flowchart: Draw a flowchart to input two numbers from user and display the largest of two numbers

## What is a DFD(ata Flow Diagram)?
Quite similar to Flowcharts, but a **DFD** shows how data flows through a system which is processed as well.The flow of the data from an external or internal source and where the data will eventually end up is shown in a **DFD**.

### NOTE: The main difference between DFD and Flowchart is that DFD is the data flow of a system while flowchart represents the sequence of steps to solve a problem!üëç
