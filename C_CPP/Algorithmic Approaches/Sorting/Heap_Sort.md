# Heap Sort

The heap sort is a comparision-based sorting algorithm used to sort an array.

To sort the array we follow two steps:
1. Put all the elements in the heap one by one and make the required changes in the array.
2. Delete the elements from the heap reflecting the changes back in the array.
