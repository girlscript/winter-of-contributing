# NP Completeness
**NP completeness** is Computational Complexity Theory. NP Complete problem are set of decision problem. This solution can be verified in *polynomial time*. It is solved in polynomial time on **non-deterministic** Turing Machine. If problem **P** is **NP** is **NP-Complete** if other problem in **NP** can be transformed into **P** in *polynomial time.* This topic is for researching.
## Polynomial-Time Reductions
- If **L1 ≤P L2** and **L2 ∈ P,** then **L1 ∈ P**
- If **L1≤P L2** and **L2∈ NP,** then **L1∈ NP**

## NP Hard 
- **L** is **NP-Hard** if for all **L ∈ NP** and **L ≤PL** is *polynomial time* **NP** problem in solvable in polynomial time. **NP** problem solvable in polynomial time (Lucky algorithm).
- A language **L** is called **NP-hard** if for every **L' ∈ NP**, we have **L' ≤P L.**
- A language in **L** is called **NP-complete** if **L** is **NP-hard** and **L ∈ NP.**
- The class **NPC** is the set of **NP-complete** problems.


## NP Complete

- **L** is **N** complete if **L ∈ NP** and **L** is *NP-Hard* if any NP-Complete problem is solvable in *Polynomial Time*, Then every *NP-Complete* is also solvable ***Polynomial Time.***
- If a problem is **NP-complete,** then under the assumption that **P ≠ NP,** there cannot be an efficient algorithm for it.
- In a sense, **NP-complete** problems are the hardest problems in **NP**.
- All known NP-complete problems areenormously hard to solve:

      - All known algorithms for NP-complete problems run in worst-case exponential time
      - Most algorithms for NP-complete problems are infeasible for reasonably-sized inputs.

## Consequences of solution
### **P=NP**
>- **P=NP** could have stunning practical consequence if the proof leads to efficient methods for solving some important problem in **NP**
>- The potential consequences,  both positive or negative arise since various *NP-complete* problems are fundamental in many fields.
>- Proof is not lead to practical algorithms for *NP Complete* problem.

## **P≠NP**
>- **P≠NP** would piratical Computational benefit of a proof that **P=NP.** 
>-  It can't be solve many problemse efficiently.
>- **P≠NP** still leave open the average-case-complexity of the problem in **NP.*
