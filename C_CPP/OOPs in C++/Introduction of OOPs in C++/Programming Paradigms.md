# Programming Paradigm
A programming paradigm defines the methodology of designing and implementing programs using the key features and building blocks of a programming language.
<br>
Let us learn more about various programming paradigms
- Procedural Programming Paradigm
- Object Based Programming Paradigm
- Object Oriented Programming Paradigm

# Procedural Proramming Paradigm
We know that procedural programming lays more emphasis on procedure than data. C++ can also be used as a procedural programming language but with some enhanced features.
<br>
It separates the function and data manipulated by them.
<br>
It may lead to many problems when it comes to extending the software or maintaining the software as it is explained below:
- Procedural programming is susceptible to design changes <br>
In this, whenever the definition of a type changes, the functions referring to this type must also be changed to reflect the change.
- Procedural programming leads to increased time and cost during design changes<br>
As changes in designs lead to many modifications in the code thereby increasing the cost. And as we have a budget for development of these projects, it is necessary to minimize these
cost overheads.

# Object Based Programming Paradigm
This is a newer paradigm which implements some features of object oriented programming but not all. In this paradigm data and its associated meaningful functions are enclosed in one single entity called a class.
<br>
Here users of a class are allowed to access its interface but they can not access its implementation details.
<br>
Let's have a look at these points:
- It localizes the implementation details<br>
 It means whenever there is any change in the definition of type, user's interface generally remains unaffected.
 - It is subset of object oriented programming<br>
  It is because it implements some of the features implemented by object oriented programming i.e., information hiding, abstraction, classes, etc. but it doesn't implement inheritance.
  
# Object Oriented Programming Paradigm
It is a superset of object based programming paradigm. It not only provides all the features provided by object based programming but also overcomes its limitation of implementing inheritance so that real-world relations
can be represented programmatically. 
<br>
Have a look at these points below:
- Re-use of code
- Ease of comprehension
- Ease of fabrication and maintenance
- Easy redesign and extension
