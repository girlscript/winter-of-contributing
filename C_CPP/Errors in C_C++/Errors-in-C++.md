# Errors in C++

We all might have faced different types of errors in our C or C++ programs. There are many types of errors such as:
- Syntax Errors
- Logical Errors
- Semantic Errors
- Run-Time Errors
- Linker Errors

Now let us have a close look to know what are these errors.

## Syntax Errors

When the rules of C++ syntaxes are disobeyed/violated, this kind of errors basically occurs. The compiler specifies us this kind of errors before compilation process. So, this error is also called as **compile-time errors**.
Syntax errors occurs when variables or statements are misspelled, when punctions are missed.

### Example:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout<<"Example"
}

```
