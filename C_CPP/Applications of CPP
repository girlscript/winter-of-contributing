# **APPLICATIONS OF C++**

C++ needs no inroduction to anyone in the modern world. Programmers across the globe have learned the language and have improvised quite innovatively to provide technology for the current and future needs. 

Young programmers are quite keen to learn CPP as their first language and therefore it would be apt to say that CPP is the gateway to the World of Programming! But since it is a back-end language and doesn't provide much output, it becomes easy for them to get bored in the middle of their learning process. To curb this problem it is improtant to know what you can do with CPP and where it is being used in our daily life.

## **OPERATING SYSTEMS**

Majority of the well known OS like Windows, Mac OS and Linux are written in CPP since it is a strongly typed and a fast programming language.

Majority of the software from Microsoft is developed using CPP. Applications like Windows 95, ME, 98; XP, etc. are written in CPP. Apart from this, the IDE Visual Studio, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office are also written in CPP. Similarly, a few parts of the iPod are also written in CPP.

## **BROWSERS**
The rendering engines of various web browsers are programmed in CPP simply because of the speed that it offers. The rendering engines require faster execution to make sure that users don’t have to wait for the content to come up on the screen. As a result, such low-latency systems employ CPP as the programming language.

Mozilla internet browser Firefox is an open-source project and is developed completely in CPP. Also, Google applications like Google File System and Chrome browser are written in CPP.

## **BANKING SOFTWARES**
One of the most popularly used core-banking system - Infosys Finacle uses CPP as one of the backend programming languages. Banking applications process thousands and thousands of transactions on a daily basis and require high concurrency and low latency support. CPP automatically becomes the preferred choice in such applications owing to its speed and multithreading support that is made available through various Standard Template Libraries that come as a part of the CPP programming kit.

## **ADOBE**

Majority of the applications developed by Adobe Systems are developed in CPP programming language like Photoshop, ImageReady, Illustrator and Adobe Premier.

## **GAMING**

CPP is one of the most widely-used programming languages in game development. It has been used to develop games, such as World of Warcraft, Counter-Strike, and StarCraft, game engines like Unreal Engine, and gaming consoles, including Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.

Gaming involves lots of resource-intensive functions, whether it’s generating graphics or facilitating multiplayer sessions. CPP helps in optimizing the use of resources, such as allowing programmers to adjust exactly how data structures and memory allocation are handled.

## **IoT Devices**

IoT (Internet of Things) devices include embedded systems that often rely on CPP. Some examples of these devices are appliances, cars, smartwatches, TVs, and medical devices. Because the hardware is often embedded inside of an object, these devices have to operate with limited computing resources and strict power requirements. CPP helps programmers control how these resources are used in order to run programs more efficiently.

Here, I have listed a few real world applications of CPP primarily focussing on young developers. Apart from these CPP is also used in Movie production, Graphic designing, Medical technology, aeroplane softwares, AR/VR, machine lerning etc and therefore it is adequate to say that CPP is one of the most important languages to learn.
