# Advantages of Binary Search Algorithm
1)Since it follows the technique to eliminate half of the array elements, it is more efficient as compared to linear search for large data.
2)Better time complexity and thus takes less compilation time. 
3)An improvement over linear search as it breaks the array down in half rather than sequentially traversing through the array elements.

# Limitations of Binary Search Algorithm
1)Binary Search algorithm could only be implemented over a sorted array. 
2)Small unsorted arrays would take considerate time in sorting and then searching the desired element. So, binary search is not preferred in such cases.
3)It has poor locality of reference compared to linear search algorithm when comes to in-memory searching for short intervals.

# Applications of Binary Search
1)This algorithm is used to search element in a given sorted array with more efficiency.
2)It could also be used for few other additional operations like- to find the smallest element in the array or to find the largest element in the array.
