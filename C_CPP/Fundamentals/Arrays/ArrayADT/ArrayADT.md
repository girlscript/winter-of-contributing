# Array As Abstract Datatype

First let us grab some information about `Datatypes` and `Abstract Datatypes`.

## Datatype

Datatype is defined using these two conditions:
``` 
1. Representation of data: 
   How a data is represented or stored.

2. Operation on data:  
   operations allowed on data of specified datatype.
```

Let us understand this by an example of integer datatype:
```
int x;
 Here integer datatype takes some specific space in memory, like 2 bytes or 4 bytes, according to compilers need to store data, it is the reperesentaion of data.

 Also, we can perform operations like +, -, * ,/ etc. on data of int type. 

 So, from above we can say that these two condition are used to define a datatype
```

## Abstract Datatype

Abstract means hiding internal details. Abstract datatypes are the datatypes which we can use without knowing its internal details i.e. it must satisfy the above two conditions of datatype but we need not to know how the data is arranged inside the memory or how the compiler is performing various operations. we are just interested in the result generated by compiler after performing those operations.

Let us take an example of a list to understand ADT:
```
	List: 1 2 3 4 5

For representing this list we need three things 
	1. Space to store list elements
	2. Capacity of list i.e. maximum no. of elements it can store
	3. length of list i.e. how many elements are already present in the list
	
	Here we can represent list in 2 ways either using *Array* or *Linked list*
	
	Here are some operations we can perform on the list:
	Add(element)
	Remove(element)
     .
	 .
	 .
	etc.
```
	
Here, we have the representation of list and operations we can perform on it but we need not to worry about how those representations are done or how the data is arranged inside memory. So, it is a abstract datatype.

## Array As ADT(Abstract DataType)

Now let we get to know about Array as ADT.
 we know that array is a basic data structure and it is the collection of items of similar datatypes at contiguous memory location. <br>
To represent  an array  we need to have
```
	1. Array space
	2. Size of array(max no. of elements it can store)
	3. Length of array(no. of elements present)
```

Various Operations we can perform on an array are
```
	1. Display(): To display the elements of array
	2. Add()/Append(x):  Adding or appending an element in an array
	3. Insert(index, x): inserting element at given index in an array
	4. Delete(index): deleting an element present at specified index in an array
        .
        .
        .
        etc.
```
and much more. <br>
`So, data structure array and set of operations together, we can call it as Array ADT.`
<br>

We are going to see implementation of these operations in a single program:
## C program to perform above operations on an array

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

//Defining structure ArrayADT for representation of array i.e. space for it, it's size and length
typedef struct ArrayADT
{
    int *a;
    int size;
    int length;
} Array;

//Displaying elements of array
void display(Array arr)
{
    int n = arr.length;
    printf("\nArray elements are\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        printf("%d ", arr.a[i]);
}

//Adding/Appending element in an array by passing parameter using call by address. here we are passing structure as parameter
void Add(Array *arr)
{
    int x, n = arr->length;
    printf("\nEnter element you want to add in array: ");
    scanf("%d", &x); //taking element as input to append in array
    arr->a[n] = x;   //appending element in array
    arr->length++;   //increasing length of array as no. of elements increased in array
    printf("\nElement %d Added in the Array\n", x);
}

// Inserting element in an array by passing parameter using call by address. here we are passing structure as parameter
void Insert(Array *arr)
{
    int in, x, n = arr->length;
    printf("Enter index where you want to insert element in array: ");
    scanf("%d", &in); //taking index as input where element is to be inserted in array

    //checking condition if index is correct or not
    if (in >= 0 && in < n)
    {
        printf("Enter number you want to insert in array at index %d: ", in);
        scanf("%d", &x); //taking element as input to insert in array

        //loop to move every element at next index until input index doesn't becomes empty
        for (int i = n; i > in; i--)
            arr->a[i] = arr->a[i - 1];

        arr->a[in] = x; //inserting element at given index in array
        arr->length++;  //increasing length of array as no. of elements increased
        printf("\nElement %d inserted at position %d in array\n", x, in);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Enter non-negative value less than or equal to size of the array: ");
        scanf("%d", &in);
    }
}

//Removing an element from an array by passing parameter using call by address. here we are passing structure as parameter
void Delete(Array *arr)
{
    int n = arr->length, temp, index;
    printf("\nEnter Index of the element you want to delete: ");
    scanf("%d", &index); //taking index as input to delete the element present there

    //condition to check if given index is correct or not
    if (index >= 0 && index < n)
    {
        temp = arr->a[index]; //storing value present at input index in temp variable

        for (int i = index; i < n - 1; i++)
            arr->a[i] = arr->a[i + 1];
        printf("\nElement %d from index %d is deleted\n", temp, index);
        arr->length--;
    }
}

//driver function
int main()
{
    Array arr; //creating variable of structure ArrayADT
    int n;
    printf("Enter size of array: ");
    scanf("%d", &arr.size);                        //taking size of array as input
    arr.length = 0;                                //assign length of array 0
    arr.a = (int *)malloc(arr.size * sizeof(int)); //creating dynamic array
    printf("Enter no. of elements in array: ");
    scanf("%d", &n); //taking no. of elements present in array as input
    printf("Enter elments of array\n");

    //taking elements of array as input
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &arr.a[i]);

    arr.length = n; //assign length of array as n

    //calling functions
    display(arr);
    Add(&arr);
    Insert(&arr);
    Delete(&arr);
    display(arr);
    return 0;
}
```

### Sample Output
```
Enter size of array: 10
Enter no. of elements in array: 5
Enter elments of array
1 2 3 4 5

Array elements are
1 2 3 4 5 
Enter element you want to add in array: 6

Element 6 Added in the Array
Enter index where you want to insert element in array: 2
Enter number you want to insert in array at index 2: 7

Element 7 inserted at position 2 in array

Enter Index of the element you want to delete: 3

Element 3 from index 3 is deleted
Array elements are
1 2 7 4 5 6 
```
