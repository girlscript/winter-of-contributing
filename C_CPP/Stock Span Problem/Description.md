# Stock Span Problem
The problem statement states that -*"The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to today's price."*

So according to the statement we have to **find the span of days for the given input of the prices of a stock for the given number of days**.

I am presenting the code and the logic of this problem which I developed during my practice of stack problems.
