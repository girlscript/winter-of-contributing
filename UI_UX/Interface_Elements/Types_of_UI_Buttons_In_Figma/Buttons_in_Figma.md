A button is an interactive element that enables to get the expected interactive feedback from the system following a particular command. Basically, a button is a control that allows a user to directly communicate with the digital product and send the necessary commands to achieve a particular goal. For example, it may be the task to send an email, buy a product, download some data or a piece of content, turn on the player and tons of other possible actions. One of the reasons why buttons are so popular and user-friendly is that they efficiently imitate interaction with the objects in the physical world.

Modern UI buttons are quite diverse and can serve plenty of purposes, with aesthetics and animations that are icing on the cake. Many also have shapes, color codes, or icons that usually convey it's functionality to the user without the need of documentation.

 - **Size:** Buttons also come in different sizes, mostly denoting their importance in a product, bigger ones are considered to be primary, while smaller ones are considered secondary.

 - **Color:** Buttons also come in different colors, As nowadays programming languages allow for manipulating color to match the product aesthetics, conventionally there were some predefined colors that exhibited certain situations.<img width="500" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shabaquib/GWOC-UX-UI/main/ImageAssets/Color-coded-Buttons.png" alt="Color based meaning of buttons" />
