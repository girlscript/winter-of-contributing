## Introduction
Glassmorphism is a term used to describe UI design that emphasises light or dark objects, placed on top of colourful backgrounds. 
A background-blur is placed on the objects which allows the background to shine through â€“ giving it the impression of frosted glass.

**Three important effects:**

1. Transparency (frosted-glass), 
2. Vivid or pastel colors, 
3. Light border.

**The purpose of designing a user interface with this design is to make a balance between three elements:**
1. Background blur
2. Shadow
3. Transparency

## How become popular?
UI & UX designers tried to pay attention to the Glassmorphism UI as a modern style and a new trend when Apple brought this innovative design to life in **iOS 7**.
Microsoft, also used this effect on Windows Vista in the name of **The Acrylic**.
But it was not until Nov. 2020, became so popular when Apple used this effect again on the latest update of **macOS Big Sur**.
Since then, Glassmorphism UI has been developed by a lot of new fonts, colors, and shapes designed by creative Web and mobile app developers to make it more popular.
