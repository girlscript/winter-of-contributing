# Glassmorphism

Glassmorphism is a term used to describe UI design that emphasises light or dark objects, placed on top of colourful backgrounds. A background-blur is placed on the objects which allows the background to shine through – giving it the impression of frosted glass.

## Tutorial

### **Step 1 :** Draw any shape
To create a card, you need to create a basic shape first. You may want to imitate physical credit card proportions. To do this, create a rectangle with dimensions, let's say: 640×400, plus a 40pt corner radius.

### **Step 2 :** Apply Gradient Fill
It is time to fill the shape. However, let’s try to use something more subtle than just a solid color. In the tutorial, we will use a gradient. Both gradient colors will be pure white (#FFFFFF), but they will differ with opacity. Set the first one to 40%, and the second to 10% opacity.

### **Step 3 :** Turn on Background Blur (imitate the glass)
It is the blurry effect that imitates the glass. Set blur value to around 20 to see how the surface of the material is changing. Obviously, you may play with your settings.

### **Step 4 :** Add Border
The elegant border adds additional polish to the element. It also helps to establish visual hierarchy when the glass surfaces overlap.

If you want to create the illusion of directional light in your design, you may want to use a gradient for the border. I made my card this way, so it looks even more “physical”.

Settings for card border diagonal gradient:
- Border: 3px
- Color 1: #FFFFFF (opacity 50%)
- Color 2: #FFFFFF (opacity 0%)
- Color 3: #FF48DB (opacity 0%)
- Color 3: #FF48DB (opacity 50%)
This simple set creates a nice illusion of interference with the environment:

### **Step 5 :** Apply Drop Shadow
The subtle shadow effect helps to strengthen the visual hierarchy and it will be much easier to distinguish all layers.

In this example, I used dark color with 24 Blur value. I also decreased Spread to -1.

### **Step 6 :** Fill with Content
Time to add some content. Fill it with necessary logos & text. To create an illusion of the imprinted layer, **fill** your content with white color, and decrease the **opacity** to 50%. You may also play with layer blending — try **Overlay** to get interesting results.

This is just a tutorial, you may change/add the settings in Figma according to your choice to get some premium texture to it !
