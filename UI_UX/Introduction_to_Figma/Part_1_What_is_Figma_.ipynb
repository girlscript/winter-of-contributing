        "\n",
        "Figma is a web-based graphics editing and user interface design app. You can use it to do all kinds of graphic design work from wireframing websites, designing mobile app interfaces, prototyping designs, crafting social media posts, and everything in between.\n",
        "\n",
        "Figma is different from other graphics editing tools. Mainly because it works directly on your browser. This means you get to access your projects and start designing from any computer or platform without having to buy multiple licenses or install software.\n",

        "* Smart animation to connect objects and transitions\n",
        "* Edit together with teams in real-time in shared design spaces\n",
        "* Version history that lets you know everything that has changed, and who did it\n",
        "* Create design systems with searchable assets, shareable styles, and everything in one location\n",
