<h3 allign="left">Vector Network</h3>
<p>A vector network allows lines and curves between any two points instead of requiring that they all join up to form a single chain. We can split and combine geometry much easily and naturally using vector networks.  You can delete anything anywhere and connect anything anywhere. Vector network helps in strokes, bending, fills and many more.
  <li>Strokes is a chain of lines and curves from one endpoint to the other.</li>

  <li>Bending is changing the shape of a curve by dragging a control handle off in space. </li>

  <li>Fills allows us to fill the area between curves with color.</li>

<h3 align="left">What is Pen Tool?</h3>
<p>Pen tool is the most common tool used for creating vector graphics. It provides such a high degree of control and precision when drawing many kind of lines, from shapes to masks to motion graphics paths. The pen tool’s functionality hasn’t changed significantly in the 30 years.Just click and drag to create smooth curves.</p>
<h4>Paths </h4>
<p>The pen tool is used to create and manipulate paths. You can create multiple shapes as well as combine multiple shapes by positioning them correctly. Paths are formed from points known as nodes and lines known as edges. It helps in construction of Bezier curve</p>

 <p> The Pen tool can be used in filling the holes too.It allows you to “toggle” the fill of different “areas” of the graph.</p>

<p>It alows intersection of graph. It enables expanding the graph, partial expansion of graph, multiple intersections, self intersection and duplicating the edges. While all these are allowed intersection of edges is not allowed. </p>
