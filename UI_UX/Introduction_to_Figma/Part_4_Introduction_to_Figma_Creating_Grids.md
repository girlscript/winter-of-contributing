Layout grids help us to align objects within a frame.  They provide visual structure to our designs. They help our designs remain logical and consistent across different platforms and devices.

Layout grids aren't reliant on the pixel grid. This means they aren't dependent on a specific resolution or dimensions.

You can only apply layout grids to frames. This could be a top-level frame, or a frame nested within another frame.

Layout grids let you:

- Establish consistency across multiple platforms.
- Make fewer decisions when defining layouts.
- Reduce the time taken to define layouts for mock-ups or wireframes.
- Support diverse layout techniques like galleries, icons, or entire page layouts.

## Layout grid basics

Before I dive into the more advanced use cases, let's cover the basics of where and how you apply grids. If you're a grid pro, skip ahead to the next section.

- Apply a layout grid to any frame - Layout grids can only be applied to frames; this means you can apply them to any top level frames sized for a device (desktop, mobile, tablet), frames nested within your design, or even frames inside your components.

- Multiple grids on a frame - You can add as many different layout grids to a frame. This means you could stack different types of grids on a single frame. Each of those grids can also be selected and pasted onto other frames since they are applied like other properties in the right hand sidebar.

- Grid appearance - You can control the appearance (color and opacity) of each grid so they are easily differentiated.

# How to Create Grid in Figma?

In order to apply Layout Grid, a user needs to follow the following steps:

- At first, select the Frame in the canvas or the Layers Panel where the user is prototyping.
- Then in the Properties Panel, user will see a "+" icon beside the Layout Grid.
- Atomatically, a Uniform Grid will appear and applied to the Frame, it is a default move by Figma.
- Users can then click on to the Grid icon to update any of the properties from the Layout Grid settings.
Now, Layout Grids are available in three forms as Grid, Rows and Columns in a uniform square. Users can easily define the size or the color of their choice to the grid. For Rows and Columns, user can easily define the height and width theyâ€™d prefer, and the same thing can be done margins and gutters.

Now, in order to change the Layout Grid, these are the following steps:

- Click on to the Grid icon present in the Properties Panel then click on the Grid drop down menu present in the Layout Grid Properties section.
- After this, users will be given options to choose a Grid with Columns, Grid with Rows and Uniform Grid
- Further a user can choose to customize the Layout Grid however they prefer it to be.
Uniform Grids can be chosen of any size, it will later determine the pixels each of the squares will contain. When a user clicks on the Grid icon and open the Layout Grid setting, they can also update the size field as preferred and the user can just click on the "X" sign to return to the can canvas.


Colum and Rows Grids can be applied together, it provides extra flexibility and control to the users over the layout. Users can very easily define the properties of the grid by simply understanding that "Count" determines the number of Rows and Columns in the Grid, "Gutter" determines the space which will be between each Row and Column, "Margin" determines the space between the Column or the Row from the edge, however it is only applicable to Stretch grids and lastly "Offset" determines the space between Row or Column from the Top or the Left.
