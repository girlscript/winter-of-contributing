- View: Control view settings for layout grids and rulers, perform zoom functions, and navigate within a file.
- Object: Apply object-level functions like grouping, framing, rotating, and more.
- Text: Format text with bolds or italics, and set size, height, and spacing.
- Arrange: Tidy up objects with alignment and distribution functions.
- Plugins: View, manage, and run any plugins you have installed.
- Integrations: View, manage, and use any applications you have connected.

### Move and Scale Tools

When you open files in the Editor, Figma will select the Move Tool V by default .

The Move tool allows you to select and reorder layers in the Layers Panel, or move objects around on the canvas.

Click the arrow to the right of the Move Tool to access the Scale tool K. This allows you to resize entire objects or layers.

### Frame and Slice Tools

If you've used design tools before, you'll be familiar with Artboards. Like Artboards, frames allow you to choose an area of the canvas to create your designs in.

Use the keyboard shortcuts A or F to select the frame tool. Create a frame with your own dimensions in the canvas, or select a frame size from Figma's presets in the right-hand panel.

Click the arrow next to the frame tool to access the Slice tool. The Slice tool allows you to specify a region of the screen you want to export.

Use the keyboard shortcut S to select the Slice tool.

### Shape Tools

In addition to drawing your own shapes using the Pen Tool, there are a number of default shapes you can use in Figma. Click the drop down menu to choose from:

The Pen tool P allows you create custom shapes and icons. Build complex Vector Networks using vector paths, anchor points, and bezier curves.

The Pencil tool allows you to add freehand drawings or annotations to your design files.

Figma will apply some basic smoothing to any paths you create with the Pencil tool. Press the Enter / Return key to edit the path and any anchor points in Vector Edit mode.

MacOS: ⌥ Option P

Windows: Shift P

### Text Tool

Text is one of the crucial components of interface design. Everything from the placement and arrangement of text, to the choice of font, has a part to play.

Select the Text tool from the Toolbar, or press the T key to add text layers to your file.

Click once in the canvas to add a text layer that grows horizontally
Click and drag to create a text layer that is fixed in size

### Hand Tool

The Hand Tool allows you to click around within a file without accidentally activating hover outlines, making selections, or moving objects.

If you're using Figma on a device with a touch screen, the Hand Tool allows you to pan around a file using your fingers.

Tip! Press and hold the Space bar to activate the Hand Tool.

### Comment Tool

The Comment tool allows you to quickly exchange ideas with collaborators. Use comments to respond to feedback, tweak your designs and iterate faster - all from the original design file.

Comments are accessible to anyone with view or edit permissions to the file.
