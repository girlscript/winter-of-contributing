The following shortcuts are useful for toggling the visibility of the Layers Panel. This gives the designer or viewer more canvas space to view or make his/her designs without any distraction on the side.

### Layers:

The Layers Panel shows a list of all the Frames,Groups,Objects or Elements the designer has used on the Figma Canvas. Figma has assigned icons to distinguish all frames from each other as well as with the help of names.

The Layers panel nests any child layers within their parent Layer, Group or Frame. Hence, it earns the name Layers Panel. This aids the functionality to expand or collapse all the child elements/layers within a Group or Frame. It offers a bunch of interactions for the designer to perform upon the selected layers that include :

- Selecting Layers
- Adjusting the z-index with layer order
- Renaming layers
- Toggling layer visibility
- Locking and unlocking layers

### Assets Panel:

The Assets Panel depicts a list of all the components made in the Figma Design so far. It also enables to browse,view and use components from Enabled Libraries. In order to create an instance or copy of one of such components,Figma offers the Drag and Drop option.

This Panel too offers a bunch of interactive functionalities that include:

- Search field helps to search for Components that are present in the current design or the ones present in the accessible libraries.
- Toggling between a Grid View or a List View of the Components.
- Opening the Team Library modal to view the Team Components.
- Viewing Local Components that were designed in the current FigDesign file.
- Viewing Private Components.
- Exploring the Libraries that are enabled.

### Pages:

As many pages can be created inside a Figma file. They provide an extra layer of organizational control while iterating over a big or complex design. This lets designers create their wireframes,mockups,prototypes and final designs in different pages yet in the same Figma file.

![pages](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72400676/140465907-d5aa2688-614c-4511-ae79-714be24a8cf2.png)
Each of these pages offers a bunch of properties:

- Having their very own Figma Canvas
- Offering to explore and Create New Designs
- Separate Wireframing and Prototying
- Commenting separately
