Making its way from a photography website to a Figma plugin, Unsplash is one of the most celebrated Figma plugins amongst UI/UX designers. What makes it efficient is, however, the drag and drop function of using any image that you like directly to your frames. Unsplash consists of more than 1 million high-quality images from different categories like nature, technology, portrait, creatures, designs, and whatnot.
