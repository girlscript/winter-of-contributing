# Basics of Visual Design - Part 3

I think we can all agree that color is hard and pairing colors together that's even harder so where do you start when you want to make a color palette. You start by googling color theory and going down the Wikipedia there's a lot of cool stuff but it's a lot of reading and not much application that you can use another option to consider is using a palette generator or pulling from a library like [**Adobe Color**](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) but what happens when you want to customize it, or you want to create something unique.

So, when you are working on a project, there are usually **two** cases:

1.	One you're already working with a brand that kind of has a visual branding, so it has its own colors and there's not much that you need to you just need to work with the colors of that brand 

2.	But other times you're just going to have to get started from scratch and think like what colors should i use on this on this website and so in that case the first thing that you have to do is you have to actually understand what the meaning of each color is.

There are a lot of colors like the primary colors, secondary colors, tertiary colors with different meanings and mood. Now you have to understand about color meanings based off on your knowledge or by referring to surroundings near you, how you associate colors with objects. For example, leaves and grass are green, so you associate green with nature. 
To read more about color meanings, visit this [**link**](https://www.empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com/meaning-of-colors.html). 
Now when you visit this site and click on basic colors, it will give you the meaning of color and what it signifies.

## How to create your own color schemes?

There are a number of predefined colour scheme standards that make creating new schemes easier, especially for **beginners**. Below are the traditional schemes, with a few examples for each. 

### Monochromatic: 

A monochromatic colour scheme uses the **tints, tones and shades** of one colour. Let's discuss a little bit more about tints, tones and shades.
When we add black to a hue, we are creating darker variations of that colour which is called a shade.
When we add white to a hue, we are creating lighter variations of that colour which is called a tint.
when we add grey to a hue, we are creating duller or less saturated versions of that colour which is called a tone.

Monochromatic schemes are easy to create but can also be boring when done poorly. Adding in a strong neutral like white or black can help keep things interesting.

### Analogous:

Analogous colour schemes are the next easiest to create. Analogous schemes are created by using **three to five colours** that are next to each other on the 12-spoke colour wheel. Because these colours sit next to each other on the colour wheel it is important to note that unlike some other colour schemes there are no spaces between the colours of an analogous colour scheme. When choosing analogous colours, it is recommended to choose **cool colours or warm colours** one colour is usually used as a dominant colour. The others are supports or accent colours if you decide to use a combination of both warm and cool colours you must do so carefully analogous colour schemes are commonly seen in nature.

### Complementary: 

Complementary schemes are created by combining colours from **opposite sides** of the colour wheel. In their most basic form, these schemes consist of only **two colours**, but can easily be expanded using tones, tints, and shades. Complementary colours are pairs of colours that when used together creates high contrast. Contrast is simply the arrangement of opposite elements things that are different this creates interest in any work of art.

### Split-Complementary: 

Split complementary is a variation of the complementary colour scheme unlike the complementary colour scheme which is only made up of two colours a split complementary is made up of **three colours** the dominant colour and two colours that are adjacent or next to its complementary colour.

### Triad: 

These simple colour combos are variants of the split complementary colour scheme. The colours in this composition are found **equally spaced** on the colour wheel. Take an equilateral triangle and place it on the colour wheel. The colours at each point come together to make the triadic combination.

### Custom:

Custom colour schemes are the hardest to create. Instead of following the predefined colour schemes discussed above, a custom scheme **isn’t based on any formal rules**. You can select your own colours and implement them in your project. If not done correctly, your project might look messy.

## Create your own colour scheme

Start with a colour that you think you're probably going to use for your project. I'm going to use this kind of red-looking thing here and I'm going to call it **Redditch red**. Make sure that it's not too saturated and also that it's not too dark. 

Visualize the colour picker now imagine a line that starts the top-left corner of it and then it bends all the way down to the bottom right passing directly through the colour you picked for Redditch red here. That line might look something like this.

![Color Picker](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=13zfRxzp7uKsTMeTdL6h_X65BDzyOlb7X)

Basically, the brighter a colour gets the less saturation it has and the darker colour becomes the more saturation we add to it 
Now here's where things get interesting, to flesh out our pallet we're going to need at least four colours that are **lighter** and four colours that are **darker**. Try to get a nice kind of like array of colour.

![Array of colors](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=11iRVuNzTfsHAbM_zG5c1r5JwAGegkXuE)

Now, we’ll add hues, change the hue slider to create array of colours in three tints, **orange, green and yellow**. These tints are for lighter shades. Now choose another three tints of **pink, violet and blue**. These are for darker shades.

![Array of colors - Hue](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1TfGpq087bhABxB7viGm-GQL7wSEJ3zKY)

Now that you have your colour palette ready, add more values. Split the colour palette in **three portions**. Select the top portion and then try adjusting hue/saturation/lightness to make it **brighter and less saturated**. Then select the bottom third and do the same but make it **darker and more saturated**. By doing this you will have your complete colour palette ready.

Now you have to mix and match the colours to create a theme.

## Implement your own color scheme

Now to creating your own colour palette. A color palette should have three sets of colors, **primary, secondary and accent colors** with the ratio **60%, 30% and 10%** respectively. 60% of the color is going to be your background, 30% would be your main elements like text, boxes etc., and 10% of the color palette is used to add accent to your projects, like to create buttons, or to grab attention to some text.

![Color Palette](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=16Gfkfvggq0zDFZMGRTi797rrmQM3khBN)

Start with a color that you think you're probably going to use for a project. This is going to be your dominant(primary) colour.  I have selected ivory, crème, and lighter shade of black as primary colours. Blue as my secondary colour and Golden yellow and red as my accent colours. 

1.	Start with **background**, see what colours go well with each other. I have these **four quadrants** of colour is because we have our primary which are these three neutrals in our secondary blue so when we're approaching our layout chances are we're going to have one of these four be our background colour.

![Background](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1O0LjSGihFbKgoAtbhnwO-hQ4iNjuyvSH)

2.	Then start with **typography** in all of those four quadrants, because you have to consider the legibility of your text. Play around with your colours and see what’s legible and what looks good. **Use Accent colours for CTA(call to action)** such as links or buttons. 

![Legibility](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Fpo8YXQ4nNf834uGcc-JhBznycUxohgk)

3.	Next would be the **design elements, the vectors, SVGs** which you are going to include in your background which is mainly used for decoration around things. If we use Accent colours here, they devalue the accent colours and they become **overused**. So use primary colours for decorations. You could add a little accent colour to small items which wouldn’t cause much distraction

4.	Now that you have four different options, choose one, and start working on your prototype.

![Prototype](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1YqrZF_lKD3ETez9TqAITBmsKR0aXED3S)

So, by designing this sample prototype, you will get a clear idea on how to create and implement colour palette of your choice. There's a lot of theory in this document. But when it comes to choosing colors, understanding the theory behind color can do wonders for how you actually use color. This can make creating branded visuals easy, especially when using design templates where you can customize colors.
