<h1 align="center">Basics of Visual Design</h1>

Visual design strives to increase the aesthetic appeal and **usefulness** of a design/product by using appropriate *imagery*, *typography*, *space*, *layout*, and *colour*. Aesthetics are only one aspect of visual design. Designers carefully position pieces to build interfaces that improve user experience and increase conversion.

<p>&nbsp</p>

*See why Visual Design is about more than product prettiness.*
> *“Problems with visual design can turn users off so quickly that they never discover all the smart choices you made with navigation or interaction design.”* 
>
>    *— Jesse James Garrett, UX Designer & Co-founder of Adaptive Path*

## **Visual Design is Aesthetic,** *Strategic* **Design**

<p>&nbsp</p>

![Visual_Aesthetics](https://email.uplers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Design-Aesthetic.jpg)

<p>&nbsp</p>

Users’ first impressions typically form in `50 milliseconds`. This fact reflects the visceral level of [emotional design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/emotional-design) — in other words, the user’s first impression of or gut reaction to a design. If they don’t like what you show them in those critical moments, they will leave. So, visual design is a vital part of your work as a designer.

<p>&nbsp</p>

> *“Everything has a personality: everything sends an emotional signal. Even where this was not the intention of the designer, the people who view the website infer personalities and experience emotions.”*
>
> *— Don Norman, Grand Old Man of User Experience*

<p>&nbsp</p>

 Many people mistake it to mean that designers include attractive elements just to maximize an item’s appeal. Actually, you use visual design to create and organize elements to 
 
 `A) lead the user’s eye to an item’s functionality`, and 
 
 `B) make the aesthetics consistent.`
 
 For instance, designers compose and arrange website content around each page’s purpose and are careful to ensure that content gives off the right **visual cues**. The smallest and subtlest details will affect what users think and how they feel. So, you must always **show them the right things in the right way**. Your enemy here is **user uncertainty**. If your users have to stop and think about your design, they won’t trust it—or you. Therefore, a visual design should **draw their attention to the important aspects and strike the balance between a fresh, powerful design and something they expect to see**. How you apply visual design will depend on your product, its organization/industry and its users (including their culture). A major factor in visual design is that you work to accommodate **user limitations** such as **cognitive load**. For example, you use chunking to help users understand and remember information more easily.

## **Visual Design** *Elements*, **Analyzed**

<p>&nbsp</p>

![Design-Elements](https://sites.google.com/site/digitalanddesigntechnologies/_/rsrc/1505690531674/year-11/product-design--technology/unit-2/visual-tactile--aesthetic/elements%20of%20deisgn.jpg)


<p>&nbsp</p>

These are some of the most common **Elements of Visual Design :**

1. **Lines** (straight/curved/geometric/organic) – use these to create divisions, textures and shapes.

2. **Shapes** – use lines, different colors, etc. to create enclosed/self-contained areas.

3. **Negative space/whitespace** – use the blank area around a "positive" shape to create a figure/ground effect or calm the design overall.

4. **Volume** – use this to show the rich fullness of all three dimensions of elements on two-dimensional screens.

5. **Value** – use this to set the relationship between lightness and darkness, typically through a light source to create shadows and highlights.

6. **Color** – use this to set the theme/tone and attract attention.

7. **Texture** – use this to define an object’s surface.

### **The Psychology of Color**

Color theory and the psychological effects color can have on users is a complex and often subjective topic. But there are certain aspects that can be addressed on a more universal level.

Things like the common meanings of the main colors (primary, secondary, and tertiary), traditional color palettes, and cultural variations in color meanings are all fairly straightforward. Designers can easily learn these basics and apply them to their work. But there are finer points to be learned when it comes to using colors in UX design.

<p>&nbsp</p>

</p>

<p>&nbsp</p>

The emotional impact of interface colors shouldn’t be overlooked. And while some colors are “universal” in UX design (such as black, white, and gray, at least one of which is used in virtually every good design out there), the colors they’re combined with can have a huge impact on a user’s perception.

Of course, the way in which color is used can also have a dramatic impact on how it’s perceived. For example, blue used as a primary color in a modern, minimalist design will have a very different feel than the same blue used as an accent color in a more complex, corporate design.

<p>&nbsp</p>

### **Cultural Differences in Color**

One issue designers tend to overlook is the [cultural differences](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/color-symbolism-and-meanings-around-the-world) that can exist around different colors. For example, in many Western cultures, white is associated with things like purity, innocence, and hope. But in parts of Asia, white is associated with death, mourning, and bad luck.

Some colours, such as orange, have universally good associations independent of culture, but others, such as white, vary considerably between countries. This might make it difficult for a designer to produce a design that would appeal to the widest potential audience.

Designers must consider the cultural implications of their colour palettes dependent on the product or website's target audience. If a product is intended for a global audience, make sure the colours and imagery utilised are balanced to avoid unwanted cultural implications. Designers might pay less attention to the consequences of the selected palette in different cultures if a product is primarily targeted at a single culture.

<p>&nbsp</p>

### **Meanings behind colors**
This will help you to understand how colors can influence on people to make decisions and how the impact that colors can have on our brains.

<p>&nbsp</p>

### *Red*
Red is a very powerful color which symbolizes **strength, power, danger, love and desire**. In Design red is mostly used to get users attention.

One of the basic colours on the colour wheel, which is extremely aggressive, is used as a warning colour and to indicate an incorrect state, but on the other hand, this is a colour that you can play with with a little to obtain some light red tints that complement the young sector.

There are several well-known brands that utilise red as their primary colour. For instance, YouTube, KFC, Coca-Cola, CNN, Netflix, and so on...

<p>&nbsp</p>

<p>&nbsp</p>

### *Blue*
Blue is well known as the most preferred and most important color that is commonly used in design. It indicates the **trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, faith and truth.**

Because light blue is linked with health, meditation, and may be seen in hospitals, health applications, and fitness facilities, it represents water and sky, giving you a sense of peace and relaxation.

On the other hand, most financial goods and social media businesses utilise blue to indicate that their product is trustworthy, dependable, and secure, which will help them get more consumers.

Some common examples are PayPal, Genie, Pay Here, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social media sites...

<p>&nbsp</p>

<p>&nbsp</p>

### *Yellow*
Yellow color is associated with **joy, energy, happiness, confidence, positivity, light and warmth**. If you overuse this color will become very disturbing.

Instead of white lettering, yellow may blend seamlessly with black text to attract more user attention.

McDonald's, IKEA, CAT, and other companies utilise yellow in their products.

<p>&nbsp</p>

It is associated with meanings of **growth, relaxation, harmony, freshness and fertility**.

Dark greens are associated with money and grandeur, whereas lighter colours are associated with tranquilly and harmony. Green, the polar opposite of red, denotes safety.

Land Rover, Animal Planet, Whats App, Spotify, Sprite, and more brands utilise green as their primary hue.

<p>&nbsp</p>

While color theory is a complex subject, it isn’t particularly complicated to learn the basics. From there, designers can build on their knowledge to create more varied and sophisticated color palettes for their designs.

A well-designed color palette, particularly one that includes some unexpected hues, isn’t merely an aesthetic choice. It can have significant psychological effects on users, which UX designers should capitalize on in order to create better experiences.
