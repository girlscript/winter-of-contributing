For example, it may be the task to send an email, buy a product, download some data or a piece of content, turn on the player and tons of other possible actions. One of the reasons why buttons are so popular and user-friendly is that they efficiently imitate interaction with the objects in the physical world.<br><br> Modern UI buttons are quite diverse and can serve plenty of purposes, with aesthetics and animations that are icing on the cake.
