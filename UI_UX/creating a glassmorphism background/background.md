<h3 allign="left">Glassmorphism</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, Glassmorphism has a glassy, smooth effect. It resembles to the feature of a smooth glass. The main purpose of this feature is to blur the background and give a trasparent glass look.</p>
 <h3 allign="left"><b>Features of background</b></h3>
  <li>Transparency - It is important to set a light background for the element</li>
  <li>Blur Background - We can give a layered effect by making the background blur and frosted effect by increasing the blur effect</li>
  <li>Right Background - The background has to be colourful with vibrant colours. Bright colours work well. Circles and blobs are good features for edges.</li>
  <li>Border - Small border of 1px or 2px can be used to give it a clean edges and add details to the element.</li>

<h3 align="left">Properties of Background</h3>
<li>Background - It is used while adding transparency to the element. White colour is used to give rgba format. Alpha value can be increased to give a transparent background</li>
<li>Background-filter - Helps to give a blur effect. It can do changes to contrast, brightness, and perform color shifting. </li>
<li>Background-clip - With this, one can decide if the background of the element extends underneath its border-box, padding-box, or content-box.</li>
<h3><b>How to choose a background in glassmorphism?</b></h3>
<p> The four main properties are transparency, multi-layer, vivid colours, sutle borders. </p> 
<p><b> How to set the right transparency? </b></p><p> Here are some steps. Don't make the entire shape transparent, just make the fils transparent. Lowering the object transparency will simply disable the background blur.</p>

<p><b>How to choose the right background?</b> </p><p>Backgrounds play a vital role to make glassmorphism effect shine better. They canâ€™t be too simple or dull, or the effect wonâ€™t be visible. They also canâ€™t be too detailed. When picking the background make sure it has enough tonal difference for the glass effect to actually be visible.</p>

 <p>Now the final step is adding borders that complete this effect to perfect. Adding a 1p inner border with some transparency to your shape simulates the glass-edge and can make the shape stand out more from the background.</p>

 <p>These are the important steps involved while choosing a background in glassmorphism.</p>
