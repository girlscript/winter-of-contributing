 ## Complete Food Delivery App Design
I have taken a reference of **Swiggy** As most of us known about Swiggy App the UI of the app is so normal, let's design a new version of Swiggy

## Why the design is better than existing design?
- In this new design i have maintained the colour through out the entire app
- In onboarding screen i have infused the different visualization rather than using ordinary illustration
- In login screen, came up with new food background which gives a new feel to the user or customer while they are approcing the application
- In home Screen I have neglected some ideas like featuring more about offers I have imposed a carasouel to showcase the fast moving foods and gave a color to the 
navigation bar which maintains the color of the app
- In the product screen i have made simple as that , beacuse in Swiggy app if we choose kebas it does'nt direclty take us to that dish so by making this we can 
 reduce the customers navigation to many screens
- In cart screen I have showcased the bill summary including taxes,delivery fee and arranged the order of products 
- Also used a notification symbol which does'nt exists in Swiggy App
- In Payment page rather that displaying the product name i have maintained a image of the product which makes the customer easy to check their food
- Last but not the least Account screen comes up with color of our app inorder to display the user details.
     
     
 **Yes, Finally we can get a visual treat for a food app which tempts customer to order more products ,
