# Food Delivery Web Design
I took reference from Zomato website as we all are mostly familiar with the UI of the website, let's redesign Zomato.

## Why the design is better than existing design?

- In this design I have changed the landing page and animated it which gives more tempting look

- I have added the navigation bar and separated the option as food, top branch, contact us, about us and cart

- In the product page I removed the option like top restaurant to make the UI more simpler and to reduce the content as there is a option to search by restaurant and filter 

- In the product page I have used card view

- I added cart on all screen so the user directly move to cart page from any page

- I have kept the colour combination same on all the pages 

- I have added a background picture in login/sign up screen

- In cart option I have moved the recomendation towards the right as it makes UI more simpler for the consumer

- In about us page I have added a Image.
