Before we look at the reasons for doing user research, let’s talk briefly about what we mean by ‘user research’, or ‘design research’ as it’s sometimes called. When thinking about user research, many people primarily think of classic usability testing. While usability testing to ensure that your design is easy to use is certainly an important part of user research, there are many other types of user research that are essential to working in a user- centered process.
User research is the methodical study of target users, including their needs and pain points, so that designers can work with the most precise insights to create the best designs. 
User researchers employ a variety of techniques to identify problems and design opportunities, as well as to gather critical information for use in the design process. A wide range of methods are used in user research. It can range from conducting ethnographic interviews with your target group to conducting traditional usability studies to quantifying the return on investment (ROI) on your user experience design. All user research has one thing in common: it helps you put people at the centre of your design process and products. User research is used to inspire your design, evaluate your solutions, and assess your impact. User research (and other types of research) are frequently classified as quantitative or qualitative.
Quantitative research tools include surveys and formal experiments.
Qualitative research tools include interviews and usability tests.
Each research method has advantages and disadvantages. As a result, each can be used to achieve a variety of objectives. Which method you use is determined by your goals as well as a number of practical considerations such as the type of project you are working on, your budget, and your time constraints. With that in mind, let's take a look at some of the various reasons why you should include users in your design process.

## Three Reasons to Pursue User Research 

“Empathy is at the heart of design. Without the understanding of what others see, feel, and experience, design is a pointless task.” 

`—Tim Brown, CEO of the innovation and design firm IDEO`

Here are three strong reasons to conduct user research:

### 1.	To create designs that are truly relevant to your users –

The most basic reason for conducting user research is that it is the only way to gain an understanding of the people who will use your design. You can create designs that are relevant to your users if you understand them. You have no way of knowing whether your design will be relevant unless you have a clear understanding of your users. A design that is unrelated to its intended audience will never be successful.
Let’s look at an example: In 2005, the Korean consumer electronics giant Samsung conducted a series of ethnographic user studies that fundamentally altered its approach to designing televisions. Samsung representatives visited people in various countries to observe how they live and talk to them about their homes and the role of television in their homes, in collaboration with the innovation and strategy consultancy ReD Associates. What they discovered astounded them. At the time, Samsung and most other TV manufacturers focused on technical specifications such as high-quality picture and sound.
The TVs were designed to demonstrate their technical capabilities, but Samsung realised that when they visited people, they saw a TV as more of a piece of furniture. People do not want their living room to be dominated by a television because it is usually turned off. So, rather than displaying their expensive TV's technological capabilities, they wanted to hide it as much as possible.
Following this realisation, Samsung significantly changed its design strategy, transferring the built-in speakers to make the TV slimmer and developing a more subtle, minimalistic design that would fit more seamlessly into people's living rooms. Technical capabilities remained important, but they had to be balanced with design choices that allowed TVs to fit into people's homes. 'Home' was the key element here, and Samsung made significant progress to complete the transformation. The challenge was to avoid treating a living room like a showroom or sports bar and instead strive for 'harmony.' By 2007, Samsung had more than doubled its global TV market share because it had demonstrated an understanding of how to make its TVs relevant to its customers.

### 2.	To create designs that are easy and pleasurable to use

“If the user is having a problem, it’s our problem.”

``—Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Computers``

People expect products to be simple to learn and use. They expect to pick them up and do things with them while only thinking about what they want to accomplish and not about the products themselves.
If your user experience is poor, people will likely move on to another product.
Unless you work in a field with no competitors, a high level of usability (and a matching high-quality user experience) is critical to the commercial success of any product. Not to mention that your users will appreciate you for providing a positive user experience. Even if you're designing for a highly specialised work environment where users have no other options, products with a high level of usability will make work processes faster, safer, and more efficient.
User tests work best when they are integrated into your work process, allowing you to test your product recursively and from the beginning.
WikiWand is an excellent example of a company that makes a living by providing an excellent user experience. Their product is a plugin that modifies the design of Wikipedia articles in order to make them more appealing and user friendly. WikiWand does not offer content that differs from the standard Wikipedia webpage, but the company has thousands of users who praise it for the excellent user experience it provides.
The content is identical, but the experience is not.

### 3.	To understand the return on investment (ROI) of your user experience (UX) design

We can easily argue the value of great UX; however, it is far more effective if we can demonstrate it. This is where studies demonstrating the return on investment (ROI) on UX efforts are priceless (or the weight, at least, of the printouts). If you can prove that the changes you made to the design resulted in more sales, a larger number of customers, or more efficient work processes, you have a much stronger case for investing in UX.
 User studies to assess the impact of your design are typically quantitative and can take various forms.
Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, argues that a long-term focus on customer experience is preferable to a short-term focus on profit – much to the chagrin of Amazon shareholders who would prefer profit now. As of 2015, Amazon was the world's largest internet retailer and the most valuable retailer in the United States, so you could argue that Jeff Bezos' strategy was a success.

#### Conclusion
* Do user research to ensure that you create products that are truly relevant to your target group.
* Do user research to ensure that your products deliver a great user experience.
* Do user research to show the ROI of your design efforts.
