# UX Case Study 1 : Redesign Google Meet

Here's a redesigned Google Meet wireframe or design that includes improvements to the web version. I have done user market research and asked many students, teachers and my friends about how we can improve Google Meet web and it has been redesigned according to their suggestions. I explored the various problems faced by current users of the web version and tried to solve those problems. These designs are made by using Figma.

# Main Screen
This screen will appear after the landing screen. This is a wireframe of Google meet web. It's the same screen as the original Google Meet Web but with just a recording button.According to my research, people have difficulty finding the recordings of their meetings, so this button will take them directly to the folder of their Google Drive where their recordings will be stored.

During my user research, I discovered that the majority of people have issues with the Google Meet mobile application. So, I tried to redesign that too. So [Here](https://github.com/DiyaVj/Redesigned-Google-Meet-app) you can find the redesigned Google Meet mobile application. Hope it will be useful. ThankYou!
