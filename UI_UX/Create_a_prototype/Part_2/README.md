# Prototype creation using Figma

### Figma’s prototype help’s making the design of interactive by assigning a link between the frames.

#### Prototypes are outstanding in the following way:

1. Follow a flow of interaction

2. portrait like a completion of an app or website

3. Present to the stockholders

4. Require a less amount of period

### Let’s get into How to connect two frames ?

1. Create 2 frames

2. Select a particular portion where you want to connect to the other screen

3. Click + to start a connection

4. Drag it to the next screen, which is your goal

* Note: If you don’t have a destination, you cannot give a connection

### From the above preview, we can conclude that it has two screens:

When you hover on the button, **Get started**, you can view a "+" button and drag to the destination.

The **Screen 1** represents the first flow of the screen

1. Click on to prototype  
2. Move to interactions
3. Check the Animation drop down and add 
4. Preview the animation
