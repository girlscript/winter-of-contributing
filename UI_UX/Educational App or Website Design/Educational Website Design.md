Why the design is better than existing design?
In this new design i have maintained the colour through out the entire app
In onboarding screen i have infused the different visualization rather than using ordinary illustration
In login screen, came up with new food background which gives a new feel to the user or customer while they are approcing the application
In home Screen I have neglected some ideas like featuring more about offers I have imposed a carasouel to showcase the fast moving foods and gave a color to the navigation bar which maintains the color of the app
In the product screen i have made simple as that , beacuse in Swiggy app if we choose kebas it does'nt direclty take us to that dish so by making this we can reduce the customers navigation to many screens
In cart screen I have showcased the bill summary including taxes,delivery fee and arranged the order of products
Also used a notification symbol which does'nt exists in Swiggy App
In Payment page rather that displaying the product name i have maintained a image of the product which makes the customer easy to check their food
Last but not the least Account screen comes up with color of our app inorder to display the user details.
