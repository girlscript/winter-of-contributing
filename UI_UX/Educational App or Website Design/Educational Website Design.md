## Why the design is better than existing designs like Byju's or Coursera?
- In this new design I have maintained the colour scheme throughout the entire web application.
- The landing Page has an amazing tagline, different options like 'Book a Free Counselling Session' with an overview of a multitude of resources available to the learners.
- The login card provides choices to sign up or login side by side which gives a new feel to the learner while they are approaching the application.
- The User Home Page shows a graph of the learning data, upcoming courses and tests as well as linked to a detailed User Profile.
- The Sidebar has all the important resource pages linked with icons like Home, Videos/Live Lectures, Notes, Tests etlc for easy navigation.
- There are separate pages for Videos and Live Lectures with detailed information linked to specific subject and available filters like Recently Watched, Bookmarks etc.
- The Tests and Test Analysis pages show detailed correct/incorrect answers with marks, explanation and time along with line charts showing progress.
- I have also included a Contact Us and Feedback Form for improving the User Experience and resolving issues/queries easily and effectively.
