## What is User Research

User Research is one of the most important elements of UX Designing.It includes :

- Foundational Research:Research that focuses on what to be built to address user problems i.e. thinking of optimised solutions to the problems.
- Design Research:Research that focuses on how to build a good and interactive design that provides such a solution.
- Post-Launch Research:Research that reflects how much we were actually successful in building such a design and solving user challenges.

It is a continuous fragment of the lifecycle of product development .Broadly it invloves studies or interviews that helps UX Researchers gain insights into product usage from a user's end.It is conducted to understand how a person,the user in this case feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.

The outcome of a well conducted User Research can prove to be a breakthrough in understanding audiences and learn about their backgrounds,demographics,motivations,pain-points,emotions and life goals.

## Basic Necessity for UX Designing

UX Designing is a necessary and one of the first steps to take a product from an idea to reality.UX Designing is user-centered.It is all about generating ideas about the users, the potential needs or challenges that users might have and thereby creating a design that solves those user problems.

UX Designing is a basic necessity due to its following functions:

- Demo Product: It acts as a product replica and acts as the building block for the next stage of the lifecycle i.e. Development via wireframing and prototyping.
- Usability: It makes sure that the structure and purpose of the product are clear,concise and easy to use.
- Equitability: It makes sure that the design and product is helpful to all inclusive of people of diverse abilities and backgrounds.
- Enjoyability: It makes sure that the product brings delight to the user.Making the user happy is the main aim of UX Designing.
- Usefulness: It makes sure that the product provides an optimized solution to the problems and challenges that the user might face.

Most UX Designers do need to conduct some form of user research to make sure that theyâ€™re building something users actually want.

Both Market Research and User Research are fundamental in steering a product in the right path.But they target different aspects and areas of the process.
