Progress bar or loading bar can be made easily in Figma using the smart animate interaction prototyping option.
- First, I created a rectangle with some gradient in it (this is optional).
-	Followed by which, I created a frame of very small length in which I put the rectangle and placed it in the main phone frame.
-	Then I made a duplicate of the main phone frame and in this, I increased the size of the loading bar frame.
-	I kept making duplicates and progressively kept increasing the size of the bar till it was of full length.
-	I then applied the prototyping interaction between the consecutive frames using “delay” and smart animate. The time for each interaction depends on the designer. I kept each of them as 1200ms for a sufficient
time duration.
