## ECMAScript
- JavaScript was invented by Bredan Eich in 1995, with a trademark of **Oracle** (which led to Microsoft calling its JavaScript dialect "JScript").
- Thus, when it came to standardization, a different name had to be used. **ECMAScript** was chosen, because the corresponding standard is hosted by Ecma International.
- The term **ECMAScript** is also frequently used to denote language versions (such as ECMAScript 5).
- ECMAScript versions have been abbreviated to ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6.
- Since 2016, new versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016 / 2017 / 2018).

#### ECMA-262
The ECMA International (a standard organization) has created the ECMA-262 standard which is the official specificarion of the ECMAScript language.<br>

#### ECMA's Technical Committee 39 (TC39)
It is the group of people (Brendan Eich and others) who develop the ECMA-262 standard.<br>

## Summary
- ECMAScript is the “official” name for JavaScript. It was eventually abandoned and ES3.1 became ES5, which is the JavaScript version used in the **“HTML5”** world.
- The main understanding of ES5 and ES6 can explore your JavaScript knowledge as well ES7,ES8,ES9.
