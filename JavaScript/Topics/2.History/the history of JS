## What is Java Script?

Its one of the three core languages used to develop websites. Just like HTML and CSS which gives struicture and style to the website, Java Script or simply JS adds functionality to it and interact with visitors in many imaginitive ways.

## Origin

In the early mid 1990s, when Netscape & Microsoft, were in the midst of browser war with Netsacpe's Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer locking horns now and then, Netscape's programmer, **Brendan Eich** ![Brendan-Eich](founder.jpeg) scripted a new language in just 10 days, originally called Mocha, which later changed its name to Live-Script, due to its live interraction with the user, and finally into JavaScript.

## JavaScript vs Java

Many people have the confusion, are these same? No!!!! JS (JavaScript) and Java have nothing in common. The name came from **NETSCAPE'S** 
![ecmascript](netscape.png) support of Java's applet within its browser, although the name initially was **MOCHA**, which was renamed to LiveScript, due to its live interraction with the user, and then to ECMAscript or JavaScript.
Many believe that the renaming was a marketting strategy, to divert attention from Java which was the most hyped and buzzed language at that time.

## ECMAscipt's Birth

In 1997, when JavaScript started a rapid growth, people felt that it was needed to be properly handled & maintained. The Netscape started the work of creating a language specification to the **ECMA(European Computer Manufacture's Association)** a body founded, whose aim was to standarize computing all over the world. The ECMA specification was then labelled as ECMAscript and was thus included in the JavaScript.
