## What is Dependency Injection ?
> "Dependency Injection is a technique whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object" â€” Wikipedia

- In simple terms, Dependency Injection is a design pattern that helps avoid hard-coded dependencies for some piece of code or software.
  The dependencies can be changed at run time as well as compile time. We can use Dependency Injection to write modular, testable and maintainable code:
  
  - **Modular:** The Dependency Injection helps create completely self-sufficient classes or modules
  - **Testable:** It helps write testable code easily eg unit tests for example
  - **Maintainable:** Since each class becomes modular, it becomes easier to manage it

- Consider the Example
```php
class Profile {
    public function activateAccount(Setting $activate)
    {
        $activate->isActive = True;
    }
}
```
Because we need to use the `$setting` object inside the function, we inject/pass it as a parameter.
- Creating objects directly within the class is inflexible because it commits the class to particular objects and makes it impossible to change the instantiation 
  later independently from (without having to change) the class. It stops the class from being reusable if other objects are required, and it makes the class hard 
  to test because real objects can not be replaced with mock objects.

## The Actual Problem 
- Consider the following Example: 

```php
function getEmployees() {
     global $database;
     return $database->getAll('active');
}
```
- Here the function `getUsers` has dependency on the `$database` variable (known as Tight Coupling), arising the following problems: 


## Types of Dependency Injections
There are three types of dependency injection 
1. Constructor Injection
2. Method Injection
3. Property Injection.
