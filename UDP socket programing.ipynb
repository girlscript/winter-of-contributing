        "UDP is a Transport Layer protocol. UDP is a part of the Internet Protocol suite, referred to as UDP/IP suite. Unlike TCP, it is an unreliable** and connectionless protocol.** So, there is no need to establish connection prior to data transfer.\n",

        "\n",
        "UDP uses IP to get a datagram from one computer to another. UDP works by gathering data in a UDP packet and adding its own header information to the packet. This data consists of the source and destination ports to communicate on, the packet length and a checksum. After UDP packets are encapsulated in an IP packet, they're sent off to their destinations. At last _To receive data through UDP we need a port number only _and to send data through UDP you should have a port number and ip address.\n",
