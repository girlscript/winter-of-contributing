# Strong Type Languages

A strongly typed programming language is the one in which once the type of a variable is declared it cannot be changed later in the program.

The term Strongly typed is self explanatory,it means that the type of variable is strong(i.e it cannot be changed).

**Note :** This does not mean that the value of the variable(say x) cannot be typecasted. The value can still be typecasted and saved in some other variable(say y), but the type of the original variable(x) cannot be changed throughout the program.

#

### Here is a small piece of code to for better explanation:

**Example code:**

```Java
int x = 10; // integer data type is mentioned

// Now strongly typed language does not allow  this :

double x = 1.5; //since the variable was already initialized as int it cannot be  reinitialized as double

```

**This code above will raise an error**

## Some examples of Strongly typed languages :

- Java
- C
- TypeScript
- Ruby
- Smalltalk
