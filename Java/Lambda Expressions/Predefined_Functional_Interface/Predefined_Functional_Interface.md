## Introduction

Java furnishes utilitarian interfaces to manage practical programming by utilizing lambda and technique references that goes under java.util.function bundle. Each predefined utilitarian interface has its attributes.

>Some of the major ones are :
* Predicate
* Consumer
* Supplier 
* Function

## Predicate

* It accepts a single input.
* It is used for conditional checks.
* It supports test() which is a single abstract method.
* It always returns a Boolean type.

**For example :**
```java
import java.util.function.Predicate;

public class InBuiltFunctionalInterfaceExamples {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Predicate ageTester = (x) -> x>18;
        if(ageTester.test(15))
        {
            System.out.println("You can vote");
        }
        else
        {

            System.out.println("You are too young");
        }
    }
}
```
**Output:**

```
You are too young
```
## Function

* It is used for performing logic on a given input.
* It takes two arguments in which first is used to represent input and second is used for output.
* It supports apply() which is a single abstract method.
* Its return type can be varied.

**For example :**
```java
import java.util.function.Function;

public class InBuiltFunctionalInterfaceExamples {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Function calculator = (x) -> 4*4;
        System.out.println("Square : "+calculator.apply(4));
    }
}
```
**Output:**

```
Square: 16
```
## Consumer

* Single input argument is accepted and nothing is returned.
* It upholds a single abstract method named accept().
* It doesnâ€™t have any return type.

**For example :**
```java
import java.util.function.Consumer;

public class InBuiltFunctionalInterfaceExamples {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Consumer display = (x) -> System.out.println("I am displaying "+ x);
       display.accept(10);
    }
}
```
**Output:**

```
I am displaying 10
```
## Supplier

* No argument is accepted but it returns a value.
* It must return something.
* It upholds a single abstract method named get().

**For example :**
```java
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.function.Supplier;

public class InBuiltFunctionalInterfaceExamples {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Supplier date = () -> new Date();
        System.out.println("Date : "+date.get());

    }
}
```
**Output:**

```
Date : Thu Oct 21 13:56:32 GMT 2021
```
