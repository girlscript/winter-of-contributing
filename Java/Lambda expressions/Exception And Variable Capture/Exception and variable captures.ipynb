    "For example,  a lambda expression can use an instance or static variable defined by its enclosing class. A lambda expression also has access to both explicitly and implicitly, which refers to the invoking instance of the lambda expressionâ€™s enclosing class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a lambda expression can obtain or set the value of an intrinsic or static variable and call a method define by its enclosing class.\n",

    "(1)  Any local variable, formal parameter, or exception parameter used but not declared in a lambda expression must either be declared final or be effectively final , or a compile-time error occurs where the use is attempted.\n",

    "(2)  Any local variable used but not declared in a lambda body must be definitely assigned before the lambda body, or a compile-time error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3)  Similar rules on variable use apply in the body of an inner class . The restriction to effectively final variables prohibits access to dynamically-changing local variables, whose capture would likely introduce concurrency problems. Compared to the final restriction, it reduces the clerical burden on programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4)  The restriction to effectively final variables includes standard loop variables, but not enhanced-for loop variables, which are treated as distinct for each iteration of the loop."
