# Switch Expressions in Java

<img src="https://java.tutorials24x7.com/uploads/2020-06-20/banner/tutorials24x7-switch-statements-and-expressions-in-java-banner.jpg" />
A switch expression is an expression that is used when we need to use multiple conditions in our program. Now we can use this because if we use multiple If, else if, and else statements in the program, it will be difficult for the programmer and program to understand and write the code.
So the syntax of the Switch Expressions is-:

### Syntax-:
<pre><code>

switch(expression){
	case one:
		//code block
		break;          //This will terminate the current case
	case two:
		//code block
		break;
	default:
		//code block  (This will get executed if nothing is executed)
		break;
}
</code></pre>
-   If the break statement is not used then it will continue with other cases.
-   Duplicate cases are not allowed in Switch Case.

### Example-:

<pre><code>
switch(expression){
	case one:
		//code block
		break;          //This will terminate the current case
	case one:
		//code block
		break;
	default:
		//code block  (This will get executed if nothing is executed)
		break;
}
</code></pre>
**The above code will give an error**

Switch statement example-:
--------------------------

<pre><code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Switch {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        String fruit = in.next();
        switch(fruit){
            case "Mango":
                System.out.println("King of fruits");
                break;
            case "Apple":
                System.out.println("Bye bye doctor");
                break;
            case "Orange":
                System.out.println("Hey Vitamin C");
                break;
            case "Grapes":
                System.out.println("Balls of green");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("New object!!!");
                break;
        }
        in.close();
    }
}
</code></pre>

Now the above code is how most of the people used the switch case statements, but Some more methods by which you can use them in our code are given below-:

-   Using switch expressions in our Programme
    ------------------------

## 1\. **Returning Value using Arrow Label**

Now it must be difficult writing all those break statements again and again so with the new versions of Java they introduced a new method/syntax of writing switch-case statements. The arrow pointer variable is beneficial to use instead of if-else statements as we don't need to use any break statements because if we forget to use them, then the code will keeps on running and all left out cases will get executed.

### Syntax of Arrow Label-:

<pre><code>

switch(expression){
	case one-> //do this;
	case two-> //do this;
	case three-> //do this;
	default-> //do this;
</code></pre>
When the Java runtime matches any of the labels to the left of the arrow, it runs the code to the right of the arrow and does not fall through; it does not run any other code in the switch expression (or statement). If the code to the right of the arrow is an expression, then the value of that expression is the value of the switch expression.

Now if we will use the above syntax of switch case statements then JRE(Java Runtime Environment) will match the labels to the left side of the arrow, it will run the code to the right of the arrow and it will not fall through, it won't be running any code in the switch statement. Now if the code on the right side of the arrow may be an expression then the value of the expression is what is the value of the switch expression.

An example of the new kind of switch case is given below-:

### Example of Arrow Label-:

<pre><code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Switch {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        String fruit = in.next();
        switch(fruit){
            case "Mango"-> System.out.println("King of fruits");
            case "Apple"-> System.out.println("Bye bye doctor");
            case "Orange"-> System.out.println("Hey Vitamin C");
            case "Grapes"-> System.out.println("Balls of green");
            default-> System.out.println("New object!!!");
        }
        in.close();
    }
}

</code></pre>

## 2\. **Returning Value using YIELD-:**

Now the newer versions of JAVA also have introduced the yield statement. The yield statements are used for returning the values back to the variables. For example, you want your switch case to work like a function that returns some values then we can use yield statements just like return statements. The yield statements make it easier for all of us to differentiate between switch statements and switch expressions. We can not use yield statements in switch cases while we can use them in switch expressions, and we can not use break in switch expressions and we can use break in switch-case statements. So we can say that yield statements help us differentiate between the two.

### Example of YIELD-:

<pre><code>
int num_of_fruits_to_buy = switch (fruit) {
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â case APPLE,BANANA,GUAVA -> {
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â System.out.println(5);
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â yield 5;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â }
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â case PAPAYA -> {
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â System.out.println(7);
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â yield 7;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â }
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â case LICHI,MANGO -> {
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â System.out.println(8);
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â yield 8;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â }
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â case WATERMELON -> {
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â System.out.println(2);
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â yield 2;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â }
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â default -> {
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â System.out.println("The fruit selected is not Avaialable!!!");
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â }
Â Â Â Â };Â Â 
</pre></code>

### Single Case Evaluates for More than one Matches:-

Now here we can see that a single object i.e. some Object can two times give the same output.

<pre><code>
switch (someObject) {
   case ClassOne first, ClassTwo second ->  System.out.println("Type of Class One or Two");
   case ClassThird thr, ClassFour frh ->  System.out.println("Type of Class Third or Fourth");
}
</pre></code>

* * * * *

We also should know that-:

- When we use Switch Expression, the expressions should complete normally with a value or it can also complete by throwing an exception(abruptly).
- When we are in any iteration statements such as loops we can not use any statements like break, continue inside the switch case statements.
- When we create a switch expression that doesn't yield a value it will throw an error as //Group doesn't contain a yield statement.
