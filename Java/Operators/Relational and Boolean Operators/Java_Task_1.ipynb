        "*   **```==``` (Equality Operator)**: This operator checks for equality on two sides and returns boolean `true` if the results holds, else `false`. It is not to be confused with `=` (assignment) operator which is used for assignment of values to variables. *Example:* \n",
        "\n",
        "  `System.out.println(\"satish\"==\"satish\"); //returns true`\n",

        " `System.out.println((3*4+3)<(3*3+4)); //returns false`\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        " `System.out.println((3>2) || (2<3)); //true`\n",
