        "Since Java 5, we have a feature called autoboxing. With this feature, we need not be concerned that the class will return a wrapper class or the primitive data type as Java does the conversion for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Java compiler automatically does the conversion of the primitive class into its corresponding wrapper class. For example  converting an int to an Integer, boolean to Boolean and so on.\n",
