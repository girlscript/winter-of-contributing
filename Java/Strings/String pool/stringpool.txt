 String pool :
	String Pool in java is a pool of Strings stored in Java Heap Memory. 
   String is a special class in java and we can create String objects using a 
	new operator as well as providing values in double-quotes.
	String s1 = "Hello";
	String s2 = "Hello";
	String s3 =  new String("Hello");
   
       s1 ans s2 are equal but s1 ans s3 are not equal.
   String Pool is possible only because String is immutable in Java and its implementation of String interning concept. 
	String pool is also example of Flyweight design pattern.
