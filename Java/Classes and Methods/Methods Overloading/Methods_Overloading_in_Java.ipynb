        "In Java, we can define two or more methods within the same class that have the same name, as long as their declared parameters are different. The methods are then known as ***overloaded***, and the process is known as ***method overloading***. Method overloading is one of the ways Java implements it's *polymorphism* concept (a part of OOPs principle).\n",
        "\n",
        "When an overloaded method is called, Java uses the type and/or number of arguments to to determine which overloaded method should be called. Thus, it is **very important** that the overloaded methods *must differ either in the type and/or number of their parameters.* Overloaded methods may differ in return types, but return type alone is not sufficient to distinguish the overloaded methods. When an overloaded method is invoked, Java executes the method whose parameters match the arguments used in the call.\n",

        "Method overloading supports polymorphism as it is one way of Java to implement the \"one interface, multiple methods\" concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand it better consider the following. In some languages that do not support method overloading, each method definition needs to be unique. Like in C or languages with no OOPS concept, <b>abs()</b> returns absolute value of integer,<b>labs()</b> returns absolute value of long and <b>fabs()</b> returns absolute value of floating-points. Since C does not support overloading, it has to make three functions with unique name. This increases the complexity of the program. But it is not same with Java, because for absolute value you only need to call <b>Math.abs()</b> for all numeric type. It is left with the compiler to choose the right <i>specific</i> version of the function. Thus overloading helps reduce several names to one and helps manage greater complexity.\n",
