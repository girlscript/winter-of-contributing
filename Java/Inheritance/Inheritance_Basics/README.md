##INHERITANCE-

Inheritance is one of an important topic in Object Oriented Programming Language . Inheritance is a mechanism in which one Derivedclass acquires all the data members and methods(functions) of the BaseClass just like as a child inherits traits from his/her parents.

The concept of using Inheritance is we can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.

#Now, the question is why to use Inheritance ?

1) Code Reusability --> the capacity to repurpose pre-existing code i.e Deriving classes from Baseclass
2) For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved)

#Types of Inheritance :
There are basically 5 types of Inheritance in Java:
1) Single Inheritance - It is a type of Inheritance in which One Derivedclass inherits all the proprities of a Baseclass , example - class B extends class A.
2) Multilevel Inheritance - It is defined as when a class extends a class that extends another class
 example- class C extends class B, and class B extends class A.
3) Multiple Inheritance - It is a type of Inheritance in which a Derived class acquires the properties of more than one Base classes. example- class C extends class A and class B.
4) Hierarchial Inheritance - the type of inheritance that has a hierarchical structure of classes. A single base class can have multiple derived classes, and other subclasses can further inherit these derived classes, forming a hierarchy of classes ,example - class D, class C, class B extends class A
5) Hybrid Inheritance - It is a combination of all types of Inheritance . example- class B and class C extends class A moreover class D extends  class B and class C.
