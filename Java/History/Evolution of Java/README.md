# Evolution of Java

Java was conceived by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems, Inc in 1991. Basic idea behind the design of the language was that it is
1. Simple
2. Secure
3. Portable
4. Object oriented
5. Robust
6. Multi-threaded
7. Architecture-neutral
8. Interpreted
9. High Performance 
10. Distributed
11. Dynamic

While the first version of java was nothing short of revolutionary, it still managed to grow at a rapid rate. Each upgrade in the java consisted of major upgrades which reconfigured the way things were handled. The following timeline of upgrades breifly defines the evolution of java through the years.
