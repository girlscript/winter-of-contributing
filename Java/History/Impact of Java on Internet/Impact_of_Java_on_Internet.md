# Impact of Java on Internet

Earlier Java was known as "oak" after providing services like platform independence and creating 
softwares to be embedded in various devices like consumer electronic and IoT devices, it was
renamed as Java in 1995.
Java has taken object oriented concepts from C++. It is a coordinated, logically oriented and practical language.
Java is for internet programming like C is for system programming.

## What is Internet ?
Internet is a vast connection that connects computers all over the
world. It is a wide area network. On a network there are hosts as they are 
compatible to get connected in a network. Two such most common hosts 
are server and personal computer/client. Where server responses to the
requests of the client and the client/computer makes request to the server
for services.
Two categories of objects are transmitted between server and the client which are-
1. **passive information-**
like reading an email, downloading a passive code are viewed as passive information.

2. **dynamic objects-** 
are self executing programs like the server is to display the data.
These networked programs or dynamic objects present serious problems like security and portability.
IoT and IIoT devices are more insecure and more secured and portable system is required.

## Java Applets and Applications-
Applications are the programs running on the computer by the operating system. 
Some examples of applications which we use on daily basis are Whatsapp, Facebook.
These applications are created using C, C++ and Java as the computer languages.
Java has the special ability to make applets which makes it different from other
computer languages. An applet is a tiny java, it is an intelligent 
program. The applet reacts to user input and
can dynamically change the behaviour. These applets run on java compatible browsers only.

## Security-
When a normal program is downloaded then there is a risk of downloading 
a virus which is a type of program when executed replicates 
itself by modifying other programs code or other harmful code. 
This unauthorized access damages the system resources like gathering 
private information, credit card numbers and bank account details.
To provide the computer safety, it was necessary to prevent an applet 
from launching an attack. Java provides security and ensuring no such attacks
by not allowing to access other ports of the computer. Java also provides 
with "firewall" between network application and the computer. Firewall is 
a security network device which has security rules and decides to either
allow or block specific traffic based on these rules.

---
## Probability-
It is not practical to have different versions of applet for different
computers and there can be cases that the same applet is downloaded and
executed by wide variety of CPUs, operating systems and browsers 
connected to the internet. Java being platform independent can run virtually
on any computer on internet.
