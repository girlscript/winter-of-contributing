## **What is Programming?**
- Programmng is a way to give computer instructions to perform a specific task.
- These set of instructions is called Program.
## **What is a Programming Language?**
- The tools used by programmers for programming.
- It consists of a series of symbols.
- These computer languages allow us to translate the 1s and 0s into something that humans can understand and write.

## **Types of Programming Language?**
    1. Low Level Language - Machine Language, Assembly Language
    2. High Level Language - Python, Java, dot net, c#, Visual Basic etc
:point_right:C, CPP are Middle Level Languages.
## **Programming Paradigms**
1. Imperative Paradigm
2. Declarative Paradigm

### **1. Imperative Paradigm**
- It consists of a sequence of commands.
- It has the ability to reuse a program.
- **Types of Imperative Paradigms-**
  - Structured
  - Procedural
  - Object-Oriented
### **2. Declarative Paradigm**
- The programmer declares properties of the desired output, but not how to compute it
- It expresses only logic of a computation.
- **Types of Declarative paradigm**
    - Functional
    - Logical

## FAQs on Programming Languages
1. Explain the various types of errors that can occur during the execution of a computer program?\
Ans. Following are the three types of error which may occur during execution of a computer program :
     1. Logical errors - This occurs when a computer program is made with wrong logic.
     2. Runtime errors - This occurs a computer program is made using illegal operations . for example- when a number is divided by zero , the program runs after being                                    successfully compiled but shows runtime error.
     3. Syntax errors -  This occurs if some grammatical rules of programming language is made wrong while coding.
     
     
2. What do you understand by maintaining and updating a computer program?\
Ans. Maintenance and updation of a computer program starts after its installation.Program maintenance is a continuous process in order to deal with bugs and updation is one the parts of maintenance. Updating a computer programs means replacing or modifying it with a new version of the same program.


3. Every programming language has reserved words. What are they?\
Ans. Reserved words , also known as keywords are predefined in a particular languages . 
for example - 
    * Python - for , None , import etc
    * C - if , else , for etc
    * C++ - if , else , for , namespace etc
    * Java - boolean , catch , class etc

4. Difference between scripting language and programming language.\
Ans. Scripting languages are interpreted language and runs slowly . Scripting language is also a programming language while programming languages are compiled languages and executes faster . It has a fixed entry point like main() wheras scripting language doesn't have a fixed entry point.
