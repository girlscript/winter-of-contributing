# I've completed the documentation of web scraping in Python that consists of:
**1. What is Web Scraping?**


  Web scraping is defined as an automated system used to collect large quantities of data from other websites. 
  The data on the websites are unshaped. Web scraping helps collect these unshaped data and store it in a structured form. 
  There are different ways to scrape websites similar as online Services, APIs or writing your own code. In this documentaiton, I've covered Web Scraping with Python. 
 
 
  **2. Why Python for Web Scraping?**


  Python is a well-known device for executing web scraping. Python programming language is additionally utilized for other valuable activities 
  identified with network safety, entrance testing just as advanced measurable applications. 
  Utilizing the base programming of Python, one can start web scraping. Let's us see how Python is more preferable for Web Scraping:

  **->Punctuation Simplicity**
  
Python has the most straightforward construction as compared with other programming languages. 
    This element of Python makes the testing simpler and faster.
 
 **->Inbuilt Modules**
 
Another reason for utilizing Python for web scraping is the inbuilt just as outside valuable libraries it has.
    We can perform numerous executions identified with web scraping by utilizing Python as the base for programming.
 
 **->Open Source Programming Language**
 
Python has tremendous help from the community since it is an open-source programming language.
 
 **->Wide scope of Applications**
 
 
Python can be utilized for different programming assignments going from little shell contents to big business web applications.

 
 **4. Python Libraries Used For Web Scraping**
 
 
As you already know, Python  has various applications and there are different libraries for different purposes.
In our further demonstration, we will be using the following libraries:
**Scrapy:**

Scrapy is one of the most powerful and popular library for web scraping. It is most commonly used by web scrapes. With this library you can easily scrape the data from any website and store it in the required format like json, xml or csv etc.

**Selenium:**  

Selenium is a web testing library. It is used to automate browser activities. Selenium is quite user friendly and if you're a beginner then it's good to start with Selenium.

**Requests:**

Request is also a popular library of Python for sending requests to HTTP server and storing the information in HTML or csv format.
**BeautifulSoup:**

Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates parse trees that is helpful to extract the data easily.
**Pandas:**

Pandas is a library used for data manipulation and analysis. It is used to extract the data and store it in the desired format.

**LXML:**

The LXML library is appropriate for scraping greater amounts of data from any desired internet databases. To extract and parse data using XPath and CSS selectors, the combination of requests and lxml is most often used.
