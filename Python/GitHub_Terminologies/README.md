# Github_Terminology(Git Terminology)

    Git is a tool that covered vast terminology.
    Some commonly used terms are: 

    1. Branch -A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. We can perform many operations on Git branch-like rename, list, delete, etc.
    e.g.,  git checkout -b <branch_name> (Switching from one branch to another)

    2. Clone - It is used to make a copy of the target repository or clone it. If I want a local copy of my repository from GitHub, this tool allows creating a local copy of that repository on your local directory from the repository URL.
    e.g., git clone <repo_url>

    3. Fetch - It is used to fetch branches and tags from one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their histories. It updates the remote-tracking branches.

    4. Merge - Merging is a process to put a forked history back together. The git merge command facilitates you to take the data created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch

    5. Pull/Pull Request - The term Pull is used to receive data from GitHub. It fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory. The git pull command is used to make a Git pull.
    e.g., git pull origin <branch_name>
