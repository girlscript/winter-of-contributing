## WHAT IS AUTOMATION?
In a simple word, automation is a process which make a task to operate automatically. Take me for an example, I have to always check if there is any new mail and for that
I have to enter in all my Gmail account which is really tiring. 
Sometimes, I skip it, resulting me to miss an important announcement. But if I have, say, a robot to check every 2/4 hours if there is any new mail, then Voila!!! Problem solved.
But robot is a far-fetch thought. Why don't we think of something easiest and efficient to make?
Let's say a script of Python which will execute every 2/4 hours to do our work. And that's what automation is. <br>
<i><b>Doesn't it pique your interest?</b></i><br>

## BENEFITS OF AUTOMATION:
- Reliability:
> When more work is added to a system, the system can do whatever it needs to complete the work.
- Debugging:
> If you find an error in a script, you can fix the error once and for all, which isn't the case for mistakes made by humans, of course.

## PITFALLS OF AUTOMATION
- Bit-rot:
> The process of software falling out of step with the enviroonment is called Bit-rot. <i><b>Now, what does that mean?</b></i>
> If the automated file is not updated regularly then with a change of server the whole workload breaks. 
- Pareto Principle:
> In computer science, 20% of the system administration tasks that I perform is responsible for 80% of my work. And, that is Pareto Principle. 
> It is a concept that can also be useful guideline to help one decide which tasks is needed to be automated.

## EXAMPLES:
- Checking mails
- Web scraping

As I've already talked about first example, let's talk about second example with... an example. Right now, I'm doing an Internship where not much work 
has been given except for writing about 25 Apps of a specific keyword, let's say, scanner. So, we know such apps which does scanning of our documents. <br>
<i><b>Not much problem, right? But, can you do this everyday without feeling frustrated? Feeling like it's not worth of your time?</b></i> <br>
Don't know about you, but I do feel so.<br>
So if I create a script which will extract data of a specific keyword from Google Play store everyday, isn't the problem solved? And that's what automation is!!!
