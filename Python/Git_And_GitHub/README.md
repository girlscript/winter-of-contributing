# Learn version control- Git, GitHub


# Description
Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS). Git is commonly used for both open source and commercial software development. 

GitHub is a Git hosting repository that provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection of free and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace.
