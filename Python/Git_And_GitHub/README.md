we will try to understand and learn different GitHub Terminologies. we will also see it practically.

## Version Control

Version control also known as source control, is the process of tracking and managing software code. version control system are software tools that helps software teams manage changes to the source code over time. As development enviroments have accelerated, version control system helps software teams works faster and smarter. They are specially used for DevOps teams since they helps them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.

version control system keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. if a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the code while minimizing disruptions to all team members.

for almost all software projects, the source code is like the crown jewels - a precious asset whose value must be protected.for most software teams, the source code is a repository of the invaluable knowledge and understanding about the problem domain that the developers have collected and refined through careful effort. version controls protects source code from both catastrophe and the casual degradation of human error and unintended consequences.

software developers working in teams are continually writing new source code. The code for a project, app or software component is typically organized in a folder structure or a 'file tree'.
one developer on the team may be working on a new feature while another developer fixes an unrelated bug by changing code, each developer may make their changes in several parts of the file tree.

Version control helps teams solve these kinds of problems, tracking every individual change by each contributor and helping prevent concurrent work from conflicting. Changes made in one part of the software can be incompatible with those made by another developer working at the same time. This problem should be discovered and solved in an orderly manner without blocking the work of the rest of the team. Further, in all software development, any change can introduce new bugs on its own and new software can't be trusted until it's tested. So testing and development proceed together until a new version is ready.

Software teams that do not use any form of version control often run into problems like not knowing which changes that have been made are available to users or the creation of incompatible changes between two unrelated pieces of work that must then be painstakingly untangled and reworked. If you're a developer who has never used version control you may have added versions to your files, perhaps with suffixes like "final" or "latest" and then had to later deal with a new final version. Perhaps you've commented out code blocks because you want to disable certain functionality without deleting the code, fearing that there may be a use for it later. Version control is a way out of these problems.

Version control software is an essential part of the every-day of the modern software team's professional practices. Individual software developers who are accustomed to working with a capable version control system in their teams typically recognize the incredible value version control also gives them even on small solo projects. Once accustomed to the powerful benefits of version control systems, many developers wouldn't consider working without it even for non-software projects.

## What is GitHub

GitHub is a provider of internet hosting of software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git along with its own features. To be very crisp about what exactly is GitHub, it is a file or code-sharing service to collaborate with different people.

GitHub is a highly used software that is typically used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Say for example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files.

## Why is GitHub so popular?

- GitHub provides you a beautiful visual interface which helps you to track or manage your version controlled projects locally.

- Once you register on GitHub, you can connect with social network and build a strong profile.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of using GitHub

One advantages of GitHub is that the serviced allows unlimited free code repositories for all users. In github, you can also create 'organizations' that essentially act as regular accounts with at least one user account acting as the owner.

however, in some cases there may also be limitations in GitHub's usability and efficiency. sometimes there are complications between the code and the employer, for example, when a private server is hosting the generated code. Another reason for needing an alternative to GitHub is when you wish to use another VCS that isn't supported by GitHub.

## Some of the best GitHub alternatives

1. GitLab

2. BitBucket

3. SourceForge

4. Launchpad

5. Google Cloud Source Repositories

6. AWS CodeCommit

7. Phabricator

8. Gogs

## Top main benefits of using GitHub

1. it makes it easy to contribute to the open source projects

To be honest, nearly every open-source project uses GitHub to manage their project. Using GitHub is free if your project is open source and includes a wiki and issue tracker that makes it easy to include more in-depth documentation and get feedback about your project. If you want to contribute, you just fork a project, make your changes and then send them a pull request using GitHub web interface.

2. Documentation

By using GitHub, you make it easier to get excellent documentation. Their help section and guides have articles for nearly any topic related to git that you can think of.

3. Showcase your work

Are you a developer and wishes to attract recruiters? GitHub is the best tool you can rely on for this. Today, when searching for new recruits for their project, most companies look into the GitHub profiles. If your profile is available, you will have a higher chance of being recruited even if you are not from a great university or college.

4. Markdown

Markdown allows you to use a simple text editor to write formatted documents. GitHub has revolutionized writing by channeling everything through Markdown: from the issue tracker, user comments, everything. With so many other programming languages to learn for setting up projects, it’s really a big benefit to have your content inputted in a format without having to learn yet another system.

5. GitHub is a repository

This was already mentioned before, but it’s important to note, GitHub is a repository.
What this means that it allows your work to get out there in front of the public. Moreover, GitHub is one of the largest coding communities around right now, so it’s wide exposure for your project.

6. Track changes in your code across versions

When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository. Much like using Microsoft Word or Google Drive, you can have a version history of your code so that previous versions are not lost with every iteration.

7. Integration options

GitHub can integrate with common platforms such as Amazon and Google Cloud, services such as Code Climate to track your feedback, and can highlight syntax in over 200 different programming languages.
