<!--
1. Every major folder, for example, Frontend Web Development, Backend Web Development, Data Structures and Algorithm, etc, will have an index page.
2. Every index page should have a title, index with a link to all the language/topic folders, and a Learning path.
3. The learning path should act as a roadmap to the learners. The learners should not be clueless after coming to the repository.
