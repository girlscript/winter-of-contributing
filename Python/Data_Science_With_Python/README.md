Welcome to this Scikit-Learn Tutorial.
In this Tutorial you will learn about Scikit-Learn,it's applications and we will eventually move on to perform analysis on a dataset using functions from the Scikit-Learn library.
This tutorial is divided into following sections:
  -What is Scikit-Learn?
  -What can we achieve using Scikit-Learn Library?
Then we will move on to performing data analysis on a dataset.
after performing the basic operations,we will move on to pre-processing the data using functions from the Scikit-Learn library.
Afterwards,we will proceed to training and test splitting of data.
After this process is complete we will noe move  on to implement a few machine learning algorithms on our data with the help of functions in the Scikit-Learn library.
After determining which algorithm works the best,we will finally move on to determine the accuracy of that particular model.
