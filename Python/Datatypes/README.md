# DataTypes in Python 
    Data types are an essential concept in the python programming language. In Python, every value has its own python data type. The classification of data items or to put the data value into some sort of data category is called Data Types. It helps to understand what kind of operations can be performed on a value.


    ## IntegerValue = 786

    ## FloatValue = 78.6

    ## StringValue = "Hello Bucky"

    ## AnotherStringValue = 'Hey Its cool'

 
    ## Blah_Blah = True                                   

    ## list_of_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]                      

    ## tuple_of_numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)                     

    ## Dictionary_of_keyValue_Pair = {"Hey": 1, "Its": 2}
