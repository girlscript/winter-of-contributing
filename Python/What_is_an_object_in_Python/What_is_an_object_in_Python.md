# What is an object in Python

Python is an object-oriented programming language. Everything is in Python treated as an object, including variable, function, list, tuple, dictionary, set, etc. Every object belongs to its class. For example - An integer variable belongs to integer class. An object is a real-life entity. An object is the collection of various data and functions that operate on those data. An object contains the following properties.

- State - The attributes of an object represents its state. It also reflects the properties of an object.
- Behavior - The method of an object represents its behavior.
- Identity - Each object must be uniquely identified and allow interacting with the other objects.
Let's understand the object in the aspect of classes.

The classes and objects are the essential key to the object-oriented programming. Classes are the blueprint of the object. Classes are used to bundling the data and functionality together. Each newly created class must have its object. Let's understand real-life example of class and object.

A human is a class which may have may attributes such as walking, sleeping, thinking, etc. Suppose we want to name and age of 100 humans, so we don't need to create a class for every person. We just need to instantiate the multiple objects of that perticular class.

The class contains the user-defined data structure that holds the own data members such as variables, constructs, and member functions, which can be accessed by creating an object of the class.

Classes are a fundamental part of modern programming languages.  Python makes it easy to make a class and use it to create objects.  Today you will learn the essentials of programming with classes: how to initialize them, write methods, store fields, and more.
