    - It stands for Numerical Python.
    - It is used for mathematical operations on large dimensional arrays.
    - Enhanced performance through vectorization support on operations.
  - **Pandas**:
    - It is a library used for data visualization and manipulation.
    - Provides functions that takes raw data (dictionaries or spreadsheets) and converts it into a tabular format.
  - **Matplotlib**:
    - It is a library used for data visualization.
    - Outputs the result in a variety of formats like line graphs, pie-charts, histograms, etc.
  - **Scipy **:
    - It is used for scientific and mathematical computing.
    - Provides modules for linear algebra, image processing, optimization, etc.

## Machine Learning
