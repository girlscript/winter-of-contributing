# What is Python Interpretor #79(1001)
                                                 
As we all know that python is a scripting language and as well as an interpretted language .
So what is actually an Interpetor means ?



Interpreter means checking the code in a sequence (one by one) one after the another.
Interpreter is a logical layer between code and hardware.

eg. 

    1st statement
    2nd statement
    3rd statement
    ....
    ....
    ....
    nth statement 

In the above example we saw that the lines are appering one after the another . In this way an Python Interpreter works.
