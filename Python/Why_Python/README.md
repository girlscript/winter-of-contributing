# WHY PYTHON?
## 1. Easy to Learn and Understand
The primary function of machine learning is to recognise data patterns. While machine learning engineers have a lot on their plates, from data extraction to the development of intelligent algorithms, Python can help with quick and easy data validation. Python makes it easier for engineers to work on machine learning projects because it is simple to learn and understand. Python's quick implementation allows machine learning engineers to validate their ideas quickly.
## 2. Shortens the Codebase
Writing machine learning programmes requires the implementation of numerous complex algorithms as well as scientific calculations. While this may lengthen the programme, Python aids in making it simple. Python allows you to easily reduce a large codebase by nearly one-fifth. Python's short lines of code can help to improve the overall results. Because Python is so simple, the developer can concentrate on solving the ML problem rather than the language nuances.
