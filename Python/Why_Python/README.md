# WHY PYTHON?
## 1. Easy to Learn and Understand
The primary function of machine learning is to recognise data patterns. While machine learning engineers have a lot on their plates, from data extraction to the development of intelligent algorithms, Python can help with quick and easy data validation. Python makes it easier for engineers to work on machine learning projects because it is simple to learn and understand. Python's quick implementation allows machine learning engineers to validate their ideas quickly.
## 2. Shortens the Codebase
Writing machine learning programmes requires the implementation of numerous complex algorithms as well as scientific calculations. While this may lengthen the programme, Python aids in making it simple. Python allows you to easily reduce a large codebase by nearly one-fifth. Python's short lines of code can help to improve the overall results. Because Python is so simple, the developer can concentrate on solving the ML problem rather than the language nuances.
## 3. Liberation of the Platform
Python's platform independence is another important reason for its growing popularity in machine learning. Due to â€œ platform independence, developers can implement things on different machines with little or no change. Python is supported by a number of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Developers can easily create standalone executable programmes for various operating systems using Python codes. Furthermore, some businesses train machine learning models on machines equipped with powerful GPUs. This training becomes much easier and less expensive with the independent platform of Python web development services.

## 4. Versatility and flexibility
Python provides developers with a lot of flexibility and versatility. Python can easily be combined with any other programming language to achieve business objectives. Because Python allows for instant change, there is no need for recompilation of the source code, resulting in faster results.
Furthermore, the coding language's flexibility aids in reducing the likelihood of bug occurrence. Python for ML can run on all platforms, including Unix, Windows, macOS, Linux, and others, making it simple to run tests on any platform. As a result, using Python as a coding language for machine learning can help you save a lot of time and money.

## 5. Numerous Libraries and Frameworks
One of the primary reasons Python is preferred for machine learning is the ease of access to a large library. Because ML implementation can be time-consuming and difficult, the extensive library makes the task easier for developers. With Python's extensive library, developers can perform complex tasks without having to rewrite code.
Python libraries and frameworks can be used by programmers to shorten development time. Furthermore, because machine learning is based on probability, statistics, and mathematical optimizations, Python's extensive library can aid in making studies easier for data scientists.

## 6. A Gigantic Community
Python has a sizable support base. Whenever you encounter a difficulty or a problem, you can easily obtain quality assistance from the community's experienced members. Thousands of expert coders in the community contribute to the community by providing valuable input to users and making their tasks easier. With a large pool of resources, both professionals and beginners can benefit equally.

## 7. Popularization
Python's popularity as a programming language is growing by the day. The language's growing popularity around the world makes it an excellent choice for machine learning projects. One of the primary reasons for Python's growing popularity is its simplicity and ease of maintenance.

Python is the best option for machine learning for the reasons stated above. It can ensure error-free machine learning projects in addition to quick data validation. Python can ensure the maximum success of machine learning projects.
