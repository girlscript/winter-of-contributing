        "# **Why Python Programming**\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python was created in 1991 by a Dutch Programmer, Guido Van Rossum.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python is an Object Oriented Programming Language\n",
        "* Which means we create objects and classes, which can be reused to implement data and output according to the users requirements.\n",
        "* But, Python can also be treated in a procedural or functional way.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python is an Open source programming language\n",
        "* It is developed under an OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) which is an approved open source license\n",
        "* It is free to access and download for everyone.\n",
        "* It is free to use and distribute even for commercial purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python is a High-level language\n",
        "* It is easily understandable by humans.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python is Easy to learn.\n",
        "* Its syntax is similar to English Language.\n",
        "* Semicolon is not used at the end, this reduces the probability of warnings and errors.\n",
        "* It has many Frameworks, tools and libraries\n",
        "* It takes hardly 1-2 months to well understand the fundamentals of Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python is an Interpreted language.\n",
        "* It uses interpreter instead of compiler. Languages like C, C++ uses the compiler.\n",
        "* Interpreter translates one statement of the program at a time by converting byte code into machine code.\n",
        "* It is faster than compiler.\n",
        "* Error detection is easy in interpreter it does not generate an intermediary code.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python is Portable.\n",
        "* This means any source can implement the code written in Python.\n",
        "* Python works on different platforms, i.e.Windows, Linux, Mac.\n",
        "* Python can run without installing it from any open source or by USB.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python’s Execution speed is faster.\n",
        "* As it uses interpreter its execution speed is faster from other languages which uses compiler.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python has many Frameworks, tools and libraries available \n",
        "* This makes the coding in Python easier\n",
        "* Django and Flask for developing web applications, \n",
        "* TensorFlow for deep learning, \n",
        "* Matplotlib for plotting charts and graphs, \n",
        "* Scipy for mathematics applications, \n",
        "* BeautifulSoup for Web Scraping and \n",
        "* Pandas for data analysis.\n",
        "* Python is the best for automation and software testing because it just needs few lines of code to display required results.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python helps to code in fewer(minimal) lines\n",
        "* For example: Hello World code can be completed in just one line as shown below\n",
        "* print(“Hello World”)\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python is Versatile.\n",
        "* It can be used for Web Development, Machine Learning, Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, GUI Application Development, Game Development.\n",
        "* Where, Big Data, Machine Learning, AI, Cloud computing are the ongoing trends in the technological world.\n",
        "* It is a good platform for data science.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python is highly productive if compared to other OOP languages like Java and C++.\n",
        "* It has unique feature of handling datatypes on its own.\n",
        "* Python is much faster in terms of development.\n",
        "* Python is reliable more than any other programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python has a large community.\n",
        "* That community supports and develops the ecosystem by adding their contributions and libraries. \n",
        "* Easy Documentation and developer support is available for all levels beginner to expert to learn and adapt this programming language.\n",
        "* Many of the data processing workloads in the organization are powered by python programming language.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Python is High in demand in the development market. \n",
        "* Therefore, it has wide range of opportunities opened for python developers with high salary packages.\n",
        "* Python is a valueable skill-set to have for any developer or programmer.\n",
        "* Google is the supporter of Python. It adopted python programming in 2006.\n",
        "* Many big organizations like Facebook and Amazon Web Services supports Python.\n",
        "* Python is used by popular websites like Youtube, Reddit, Dropbox, Instagram etc.\n",
