# Regex In Python

Contribution Approach- Regex stand for Regular Expressions. This comprises of a sequence of characters that are used in similar ways as strings are used. Regex forms a pattern 
or code in it's representation while strings do not. 
The python module used for working with Regex is "re" and is imported by the following command-
import re
Some of the most useful functions in "re" module are->
1) findall()
2) search()
3) split()
4) sub()

Regex has various properties that makes working with text and strings easier and plays a major role in Text analysis and preprocessing in Natural Language Processing.
We can use special sequences in Regex to work with NLP. These are symbols with a "\" such as-

"\s"->symbolises portion of string with single white space

"\s+"->symbolises portion of string with multiple white spaces
