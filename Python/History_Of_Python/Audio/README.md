#### **Beginning era:** 
Python is the most popular programming language, which is famous for its readable code, human-friendly syntax, improved productivity, and its link to vast libraries. Python is a high-level programming language that was founded by Guido van Rossum and developed by Python Software Foundation to combat the bulky coding of shellscript and c language which were used in various coding applications. As the name of the Python is concerned, Guido named it being impressed by the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus".
Guido during his work as a programmer in CWI ( Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)), a research lab doing advanced math and computer science research developed by python. His first job was to work with ABC. His knowledge of language design was developed and advanced while working there.
<br /> As ABC got unsuccessful, he started working on other coding projects at the same research center. Amoeba, a distributed system was one of the projects he contributed to. Amoeba was built collaboratively by CWY and one of the universities, working with Amoeba he discovered that every application writes for Amoeba is either a shell script or c program code, which he degraded as a general and comprehensive programming language. Hence, he took the initiative to build a language that comprises features like readability, user-friendly, portability. Once python is released as an open-source within a year of its invention, pythoneers across the globe started contributing and critiquing each other contributions eventually advancing python's reach.
#### **Timeline:**
  - **1989** Python was introduced by Guido van Rossum as a succession to ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System. By **1991** Python version 0.9 was released.
  - **1994: Release of Python 01 version**
      <br /> Features: Exception handling, functional programming tools like ` lambda `, ` map `,` filter ` and ` reduce `. Other updates of version inculded background changes, optimization, and updates to licenses. 
  - **Oct 2000: Release of Python 02 version**
        <br /> Features: list comprehensions, a garbage collector capable of collecting reference cycles, supported nested scopes, and  Unicode string datatype
     -  Inclusion of unicode string enables python code to support 65,000 other symbols like emoji and non-Latin script languages like Russian, Chinese, or Arabic. 
     -  List comprehension provides a unique way to construct a new list. 
     -  Python version 2 eliminated the problem of memory leaks by introducing optimizations as garbage collectors to delete inaccessible objects. 
     -  Python 2.0 also supported augmented assignment operators that return the selected variable after executing desriable action.
     <br /> ` b -= 3 `
      -  A "with" statement was introduced in Python 2.5 version. By Oct 2006, python version 2.6 was published and was compatible to version 3 features like ` typeError `, ` bin() `, and ` _complex_()`
       The last release of the python 2 version occurred on April 20,20 as 2.7.18 version, which include minor bug fixation and put an end to Python version 2
  - **3rd Dec 2008: Release of Python 03 version** - Version 3 also known as *Python 3000* or *Py3K* has become the most popular among python users. 
        <br /> *Features:* 
       - Goal intended by the publication of version 3 was to reduce the duplication of codes by removing existing ways of doing things.
       -  ` print ` changed into a built-in function instead of a statement as it existed in previous versions. It made the syntax convenient for users. 
       ``` 
         version 2: print              # Prints a newline
         version 3: print()            # You must call the function! 
      ```
      - python 2 input function is removed and python 3 ` input ` function is introduced which behaves in a similar pattern to python's 2 ` raw_input `. In addition to it, input return as a string rather than being evaluated as an expression.
      - ` xrange() ` of version 2 has been renamed to ` range() ` in this version.
       - ` with ` now becomes a built-in function.
       - version 3 also removed error possibilities by mixing various data types by converting all text content such as strings to Unicode.
       - in python 3 the division operator return the float value instead of the truncated integer. However double operator is used to obtain integer values.
       ```
       print(5/2) #2.5
       print(5//2) #2
       ```
     Python 3.9 is the latest release in the python world along with a preview version of 3.10 available and a future release of python version 3.11 is expected in 2022.

The three most common uses of Python are Development, Scripting, and software testing. Major tech companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix, Spotify, Instagram incorporate Python in the development of scripts. Python has been applicable in fields of emerging technologies like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data  Science, and IoT. 

Libraries associated with python: **SciPy, Keras, NumPy, TensorFlow, Flask, Django, etc.**
