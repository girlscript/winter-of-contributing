    "\n",
    "$ ipython [options] files\n",
    "If invoked with no options, it executes the file and exits, passing the remaining arguments to the script, just as if you had specified the same command with python. You may need to specify -- before args to be passed to the script, to prevent IPython from attempting to parse them. If you add the -i flag, it drops you into the interpreter while still acknowledging any options you may have set in your ipython_config.py. This behavior is different from standard Python, which when called as python -i will only execute one file and ignore your configuration setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that some of the configuration options are not available at the command line, simply because they are not practical here. Look into your configuration files for details on those. There are separate configuration files for each profile, and the files look like ipython_config.py or ipython_config_frontendname.py. Profile directories look like profile_profilename and are typically installed in the IPYTHONDIR directory, which defaults to $HOME/.ipython. For Windows users, HOME resolves to C:\\Users{YourUserName} in most instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command-line Options\n",
    "To see the options IPython accepts, use ipython --help (and you probably should run the output through a pager such as ipython --help | less for more convenient reading). This shows all the options that have a single-word alias to control them, but IPython lets you configure all of its objects from the command-line by passing the full class name and a corresponding value; type ipython --help-all to see this full list. \n",

    "Note that in the second form, you must use the equal sign, as the expression is evaluated as an actual Python assignment. While in the above example the short form is more convenient, only the most common options have a short form, while any configurable variable in IPython can be set at the command-line by using the long form. This long form is the same syntax used in the configuration files, if you want to set these options permanently."

And the second is one particular implementation of Python produced with it. Because RPython uses the same syntax as Python, this generated version became known as Python interpreter written in Python. It is designed to be flexible and easy to experiment with.To make it more clear, we start with source code written in RPython, apply the RPython translation toolchain, and end up with PyPy as a binary executable. This executable is the Python interpreter.\n",

Now we use word PyPy to refer to the Python implementation, and explicitly mention RPython translation toolchain when we mean the framework.We target a large variety of platforms, small and large, by providing a compiler toolsuite that can produce custom Python versions. Platform, memory and threading models, as well as the JIT compiler itself, are aspects of the translation process - as opposed to encoding low level details into the language implementation itself."
