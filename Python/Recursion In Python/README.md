# Recursion In Python

Contribution Approaches-Recursion refers to a function calling itself inside the scope of the function. Generally tasks that can be done by looping can also be done by recursion .
Also in some cases we see that looping/iteration can make our code lengthy and complex and in that case we need recursion at our help. Recursion can reduce our lines of code and 
thus our code looks much more readable. Problems related to tree and tower of hanoi problems need recursive approach to make the code proper and simple.
Any function that uses a recursive approach is called a Recursive Function. 
In recursive approach a base case condition is created that decides at what point of time our code will terminate otherwise it will continue till infinity just like infinite loops.
Some other problems that can be solved by recursion include Factorial Program, Fibonacci Number Program.
Though recursion implementation is clean and simple still the time complexity of recursion is much more than iteration as the function is calling itself with all lines of codes.
