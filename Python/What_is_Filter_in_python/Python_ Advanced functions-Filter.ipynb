    "- **Filter** is an inbuilt function in Python.\r\n",
    "- Syntax: filter(function, sequence)\r\n",
    "- As name says it filters elements and returns result accordingly.\r\n",
    "- As per in syntax it takes two parameters i.e function and sequence.\r\n",
    "   - **sequence** parameter can be of any sequence eg.list,tuple,set,dictionary etc.\r\n",
    "   - **function** parameter takes function which we need to apply on each and every  element in given sequence.\r\n",
    "- so filter function iterates through **sequence** and apply **fuction** to each element in given sequence. If function returns true it will print result as per in given function. In short it will check either true or false for each and every element in sequence and returns result accordingly."
