# Open Source in Gaming

Gaming is the largest entertainment industry , grossing just over 250 Billion dollars!
This also might be the biggest dissapointment to the Open Source Movement.
Games are still largely proprietary and distributed using DRM and Anti-Cheat tools.

Before you start thinking how would Open Source Gaming would work , let's think about the implications


<a id="org611a4e7"></a>

## Advantages

1.  Archiving Games: Games which are not Open Source , cannot be archived , until their respective company decides to do so.
    This leads to many games being lost forever. These games could have been studied / researched and used as a base for developing modern games.

2.  Customizability: Games being Open Source means , any person with enough technical skills compile the game on their own.
    This also allows them to apply customizations and develop features that the main game could not support.

3.  Cross-Platform: Open Source software can be modified to be run on almost any platoform.Even though the original developer can't , the community will.
    This ultimately means larger playerbase and more fun!

4.  Lower-Development Cost: Currently games have budgets in the high millions .For example 'Cyberpunk 2077' had a budget of 316 billion dollar!
    Being Open Source means the large part of the development is literally free.

## Disadvantages

1.  Low Margin of Revenue: Being Open Source there is almost no margin of revenue.This is the largest hurdle in the Open Source Gaming.
