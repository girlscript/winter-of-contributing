## So, which one should you pick and when should you pick it?

Use GitHub if you only want to contribute to other open source projects. Nowadays, GitHub serves as an online portfolio for individuals, allowing them to submit their own work
and use their GitHub account in their CV. Having a GitHub account distinguishes oneself from others and demonstrates how much he has contributed to open source.


While GitLab is a good option, especially for Digital Ocean, GitLab is free for private projects, whereas GitHub requires a fee. Many businesses utilise GitLab when they need 
to keep their codebase secret. Bitbucket only allows you to collaborate with 5 individuals for free, but GitLab.com is entirely free.So, if you want to work with Digital Ocean,
GitLab is the greatest option, and if you need a place to house your 1000 repositories and 100 coworkers, GitLab.com is the best option.

When it comes to organisational use, Bitbucket is one of the most popular. Bitbucket is used by more companies than GitLab because of its user-friendly interface. 
Mercurial is supported by Bitbucket Cloud. Bitbucket also provides free private repositories that are exclusively accessible to members.

So, if you're a company looking to host a project, Bitbucket is the way to go, and you can even host individual projects there if you're not a company.
