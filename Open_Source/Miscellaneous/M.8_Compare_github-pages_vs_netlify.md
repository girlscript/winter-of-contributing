# What is GitHub Pages? 

It provides freely hosted and readily produced public webpages. Your GitHub repository will be used to host public websites. Simply edit, push, and your changes will be visible.

# What exactly is Netlify? 

With a drag-and-drop interface and automated deployments from GitHub or Bitbucket, you can build, launch, and host your static site or app. Netlify is capable of processing your 
site and ensuring that all materials are optimised and provided with correct caching headers from a cookie-free domain. We ensure that your HTML is delivered directly from our CDN
edge nodes, eliminating the need for a round-trip to our backend servers, and we are the only ones that provide immediate cache invalidation when you submit a new deployment.

GitHub Pages and Netlify are essentially "Static Web Hosting" applications.
