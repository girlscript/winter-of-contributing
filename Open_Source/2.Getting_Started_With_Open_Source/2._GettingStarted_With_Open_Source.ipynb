    "# Getting Started With Open Source\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Open source is a software that is open for all which mean there is no genuine owner of it.Open source is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution.\r\n",
    "![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*1O65lv5fjLnBdD04cS18MQ.jpeg)\r\n",
    "Some popular open source software are Mozilla Firefox,GIMP, VLC Media Player, Linux, Python, etc.open source dosent really mean to contributing to big repositories you can start by contributing to small repositories.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Why should I contribute to open-source?\r\n",
    "Open source is the best way to test your understanding in the respective domain By contributing to an open source project, you receive immediate feedback on your development and programming skills. You may get suggestions about the choice of a function name, the way you used conditional logic, or how using a goroutine you didn't know about speeds up the execution of your program. This is all invaluable feedback to receive when you're learning something new.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In addition to building your skills and increasing your confidence, all of your open source contributions are public and demonstrate the skills you have mastered and the projects you've tackled.hence creating a strong portfolio\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## How do I get started?\r\n",
    "There are Prerequisites one should know before starting to contribute\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Build a good Tech background\r\n",
    "Its really important to have a good Tech background before contributing to open source or else it might do more harm than good . you need to know about  architectural patterns, design patterns on which projects are made and\r\n",
    "well-known technologies before you begin anything.\r\n",

    "#### Learn a Programming Languages\r\n",
    "Just like people communicate with each other through languages, you also need to tell your computer what to do using a language that these computers can understand. so choose any programming language as per your choice and goal and have in-depth knowledge in it. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Ruby, Java, Python, C++, C#, Javascript are some languages you can go with. It’s not important to learn 3-4 languages simultaneously as a beginner. Start with one language and get well versed in it.\r\n",
