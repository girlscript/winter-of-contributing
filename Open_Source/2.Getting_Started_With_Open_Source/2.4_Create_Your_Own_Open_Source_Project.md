# About GitHub 

..................................................................
<b>Where the world builds software</b>
<br/>
(https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/open_graph/github-mark.png)
Millions of developers and companies build, ship, and maintain their software on GitHub‚Äîthe largest and most advanced development platform in the world.
(https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/site/about/octocats.webp) 

The ReadME Project: A look back at the community stories that shape usYou can also set a status on your profile to provide information about your availability
(https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1200x630-ReadMe-Anni-@2x.png?w=1200)
Open source software is only as strong as it is today because of the millions of developers from around the world who are making it better everyday. The collaboration it promotes has allowed us to truly test the limits of what‚Äôs possible with technology. With a community of 65M+ developers, it‚Äôs impossible to keep up with all the groundbreaking work happening, projects being continuously improved, and barriers being broken down. So in August of 2020, we started highlighting stories that showcase how developers, maintainers, and organizations are moving humanity forward through The ReadME Project.

Through these stories you, the community, have shown the best of who we are and what we can all strive to be. We‚Äôve learned, been inspired, and completely superfanned-out. Here are just a few highlights that have stuck in our minds this past year.

Being underestimated can be an incredibly powerful tool. How Limor Fried built Adafruit Industries and became the first female engineer on the cover of Wired magazine.
When the world around you shifts, you are not powerless. Sonia John shared how she bootstrapped herself into coding after hyperinflation hit South Sudan‚Äîand is now a blockchain developer and decentralized web advocate.
That sometimes a leap of faith is what you need. How Henry Zhu took a chance and made the move from a steady job into a full-time maintainer of Babel.
Accessibility to tools and education shouldn‚Äôt be a barrier. Ada Nduka Oyom showed us how She Code Africa gives women the tools to thrive as developers.
What the community can accomplish together can literally take us beyond this world. Nearly 12,000 developers woke up one day to find their contributions powered NASA‚Äôs Ingenuity Helicopter.

You can set a status to display information about your current availability on GitHub. Your status will show:

- <i>on your GitHub profile page.</i>
- <i>when people hover over your username or avatar on GitHub.</i>
- <i>on a team page for a team where you're a team member.</i>
- <i>on the organization dashboard in an organization where you're a member.</i>

<b>Announcing recipients of the GitHub Open Source Grants and GitHub Sponsors now open in India</b>
(https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GH-India-grants-for-open-source.png?w=1200)

At GitHub Satellite India 2021, we announced GitHub Open Source Grants, committing one crore (10 million) Indian rupees to support and fund open source maintainers and contributors, as they continue to build open source software and make an impact for India and the world.

<b>GitHub Open Source Grants recipients</b>
Since May 2021, we‚Äôve received hundreds of applications from across the country, and we‚Äôre working hard to continue to expand these programs that support and fund developers in India. Developers from 81 cities and 19 states across India applied, and showcased their open source projects. From maintainers building developer tools, to contributors supporting COVID-19 projects, the passion and energy of the open source developers in India is truly inspiring!

As we continue to support our thriving developer community in India, help developers shape what‚Äôs next, and create world class software, we‚Äôre thrilled to announce the first 15 recipients of GitHub Open Source Grants: liyasthomas, anuraghazra, pranshuchittora, VishalNehra, bodhish, shivammathur, ahiliation, onprem, ptrthomas, akshay2211, snitin315, anikethsaha, shikhamis11, gautamkrishnar, and gdsoumya. Congratulations!

By offering these grants, we want to celebrate and support the extremely valuable open source contributions that are driving innovation and raise awareness of this important work, to encourage more open source contributions from the developer community across the world.
GitHub Sponsors in India
Today‚Äôs world runs on open source, and open source developers build software for the rest of us. One more way to contribute to a healthy and sustainable open source community is by financially supporting the people who build and maintain it. This is why we introduced GitHub Sponsors, and I am excited to share that we are starting to open up GitHub Sponsors to an initial group of developers‚Äîincluding our grant recipients in India. Users‚Äô early feedback will help us improve our experience for all developers in India before we announce wider availability.

Stay up to date
Indian developers are truly building the future of software, making India an innovation powerhouse, with open source software development at the core. I am so excited to celebrate the impact that Indian developers are making in the country and beyond. We will continue to support and fund open source maintainers and contributors in their important work through our GitHub Open Source Grants and Sponsors programs.

Free and open source Linux games 
(https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mockup.jpg?w=1200)

Linux is celebrating its 30-year anniversary today, so I‚Äôm taking the opportunity to highlight 30 of my favorite free and open source Linux games, their communities, and their stories!

If you like RTS, FPS, space trading, roguelike, racing, strategy, or platform games then you‚Äôre bound to find something you like below. Oh, and some of the games work on Windows and macOS too, so there should be something for (almost) everyone.

In no particular order‚Ä¶

<b>SuperTuxKart</b>
(https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/supertuxkart.jpg?resize=1024%2C576?w=1024)
It‚Äôs impossible to start a list of Linux games without paying homage to Tux, the logo brand character for the Linux kernel.

Tux is the star of SuperTuxKart, a fun arcade racing game that includes a variety of characters, tracks, and modes. You can race against the kernel, on your LAN with friends, or with complete strangers from all over the world online. If you like Mario Kart or Sonic All Stars Racing, you‚Äôll love this!

Fun fact: You might recognize some of the other characters in the game like Wilber, Pidgin, and Konki from the open source projects they represent. I wonder if we‚Äôll ever see Mona?

<b>Oolite</b>
(https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oolite.jpg?resize=1024%2C576?w=1024)
Billed as an open-word space opera, Oolite is inspired by David Braben‚Äôs classic game Elite‚Äîa game I spent many an hour playing on my school‚Äôs BBC Micro.

Forge your own path in the galaxy by becoming a feared pirate, a dodgy trader, a gun for hire, or a washed-up software engineer searching the galaxy for coin.

Did you know: There are over 500 expansion packs created by the community that introduce new ships, missions, weapons, and more. Maybe I‚Äôll nerd-snipe myself into building some sort of GitHub Universe this weekend.





<b>The Battle for Wesnoth</b>
(https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/battle-for-wesnoth.jpg?resize=1024%2C576?w=1024)

Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based strategy game with a variety of campaigns involving elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls, humans, and more. Speaking of humans, hundreds of them have contributed maps, campaigns, features, and bug-fixes to the project.

If you‚Äôre looking for an excuse to get some extra green squares on your contribution graph, you can create new maps, campaigns, and units, introduce new art or music, help with translations, or even update the AI.  Check out this getting started guide.

Warning: As the thousands of very positive reviews on Steam might suggest, this game is addicting. So much so, if you‚Äôre on your laptop and lose track of time you might run out of battery. Thankfully, someone submitted a fix for that!

* [Project Repo](https://github.com/aaditya2801/ansible-eks.git)
* [Ansible Galaxy Link](https://galaxy.ansible.com/aaditya2801/ansible_eks)
* [Blog Link](https://aadityatiwari2801.medium.com/integrating-ansible-with-aws-resources-ced3f93c6f13)


## Role: ansible-eks

I have Integrated DevOps Automation Tool: Ansible with Amazon (AWS) Elastic Kubernetes Service and Deployed Multi-tier Architecture on the top of EKS Cluster. For Solving this use case I have created one Ansible Role which contains variables, files, and tasks.

## Following are the List of AWS Resources that I have deployed using this Role:

* Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Isolated virtual network.
* Two Public Subnets in Availability Zone (AZ): ap-south-1a and ap-south-1b.
* Internet Gateway: That allows communication between VPC and the Internet.
* Route Table: This contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.
* Security Group: Virtual firewall to control inbound traffic (port: 22, 80, 3306) and outbound traffic (allow all traffic).
* Two Roles: One for EKS that contains ‚ÄúAmazonEKSClusterPolicy‚Äù and another one for EC-2 that contains ‚ÄúAmazonEC2FullAccess‚Äù, ‚ÄúAmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess/ReadOnly‚Äù.
* EKS Cluster: It is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS and on-premises.
* Node Group for EKS Cluster: It automates the provisioning and lifecycle management of nodes (Amazon EC2 instances) for Amazon EKS Kubernetes clusters.

## List of Modules that I have used in Role: 
pip, Blockinfile, ec2_vpc_net, ec2_vpc_subnet, ec2_vpc_igw, ec2_vpc_route_table, ec2_group, iam_role, aws_eks_cluster, yum_repository, package, command.

## Explanation of Files that I have used in Role:

* policy1.json: It contains assume role policy document for service: eks.amazonaws.com.
* policy2.json: It contains assume role policy document for service: ec2.amazonaws.com.
* sc.yml: It deploy Storage Class with provisioner: Kubernetes.io/aws-ebs, type: gp2, zones: ap-south-1a/1b, iopsPerGB: 10 and fsType: ext4.
* secret.yml: It stores secrets in Base64 including username, password, and database name that requires in a multi-tier architecture.
* wordpress.yml: It creates WordPress deployment, exposes it with service type: load balancer, and claims the storage from the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) which is bound with AWS-EBS Storage Class.
* mysql.yml: It creates MySQL deployment, exposes it with service type: ClusterIP, and claims the storage from the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) which is bounded with AWS-EBS Storage Class.

## Explanation of Important Variables that I have used in Role:

* policy1: contain ARN for EKS Cluster Policy.
* policy2: contain ARN for EC2 Full Access.
* policy3: contain ARN for EKS Worker Node Policy.
* policy4: contain ARN for EC2 Container Registry Full Access.
* policy5: contain ARN for EC2 Container Registry Read Only.
* b_url: contain Base URL for Kubernetes Repo.
* g_key: contain GPG Key for Kubernetes Repo.

## Technologies Used:
* Configuration Management Tool: Ansible.
* Public Cloud: Amazon Web Services (AWS).
* Operating System: RHEL-8.

## Conclusion: 
In this role, I have covered the deployment of WordPress with MySQL Server on multi-tier architecture. It encourages the best practice of creating application components that are easy to maintain, decouple, and scale.

## Future Scope: 

I can add more AWS resources like KMS for creating and managing cryptographic keys for Security and Encrypting Volume, it can integrate with AWS CloudTrail to provide us with logs of all key usage. Replacing EBS with EFS, so PVC will be bound with AWS-EFS Storage Class are some of my Future Work for this Project.

## playbook for executing role:

```
- hosts: localhost
    vars_prompt:
  - name: "access_key"
    prompt: "Enter access key"
    private: yes
  - name: "secret_key"
    prompt: "Enter secret key"
    private: yes
    roles:
    - role: ansible-eks
```
