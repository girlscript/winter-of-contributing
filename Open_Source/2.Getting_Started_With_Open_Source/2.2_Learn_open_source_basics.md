# Learn open source basics

Learning to programme has never been easy. Despite the numerous ways to learn how to code, we believe that contributing to open source projects is the best way to improve your skills.

Aspiring programmers can stand out in the open source community by contributing to various projects, which allows them to improve their skills while also receiving inspiration and 
support from like-minded individuals. But most importantly, they can prove that they can build fantastic experiences that people love.

## What to consider before you go open source?

So, you're eager to get started on your first open source project. Let's go over a few pointers to help you decide what to work on.
 - ```Programming language``` : A programming language is the most basic technology that underpins every application. JavaScript, Python, Java, Ruby, and PHP are the most popular languages on GitHub (an open-source code hosting platform). There are a multitude of projects that might suit your skills and taste.
 - ```Type of project``` : A programming language is the most basic technology that underpins every application. JavaScript, Python, Java, Ruby, and PHP are the most popular languages on GitHub (an open-source code hosting platform). There are a multitude of projects that might suit your skills and taste. However, we recommend that you pay special attention to projects that will be used by a wide range of people so that you can test your code on a large real-world audience. The "Emoji" Showcase, for example, has 25 repositories to represent its popularity. Another tip on how to choose an OSS project is to start working on software you already use or software you're interested in using. This will keep you motivated to keep on working.
 - ```Project Volume``` : Large software projects like Linux Foundation or Spree – with thousands lines of code – aren't the best choice for a beginner. When you work on large projects, you're expected to adhere to the team's established standards. Another small suggestion: pay attention to the issue labels. Some issues are labelled as "first-timers-only", "beginner", "easy", and so on.

## How to contribute to open source projects?

We can't talk about free software without mentioning GitHub and related tools. Let's take a look at what GitHub is and how it can help you contribute to open source projects.

 - ```Get to know Git and GitHub``` : Because GitHub is the most popular platform for open source collaboration, you'll almost certainly use it when learning about OSS. To get started, you must first create a GitHub account and read the guide. You can help projects on GitHub by submitting issues and code contributions. Sending messages about application errors and suggestions for how to fix them is what issue submission entails. Sending pull requests with your corrections and improvements is part of contributing code. Essential skills include the ability to clone a repository and send pull requests, in addition to being familiar with revision control tools. Pull requests notify code maintainers of changes to the code, allowing them to review the changes, start a discussion, or assign them to a subsequent commit.

 - ```Join the community``` : You can without problems be a part of an open supply undertaking via way of means of subscribing to the mailing listing for that undertaking. You can locate mailing lists on authentic web sites or on GitHub pages. After being frequent to the listing, you may speak with group participants and get assist if necessary. Thanks to the colourful groups found in almost each OSS undertaking, you're probably to get brief replies for your questions.
 - ```All skills are welcomed``` : Even non-programmers can make a contribution to open supply projects! Documentation is wanted for all projects, and occasionally that is poorly written and maintained. Thus, you may assist through writing, updating or maybe translating documentation. Also, your layout competencies would possibly are available handy: each software wishes an interface, after all. Finally, you may make a contribution through coping with a network through replying to questions and guiding newcomers.

## Best practices for Open Source Software Contributions

1. <b>Read the project’s contributing docs</b>

   A record withinside the project’s repository known as CONTRIBUTING, or README, will define precisely a way to contribute. It may appear obvious to examine one or each of those files first, however it is able to be smooth to pass this crucial step if you’re keen to contribute. I’ve been responsible of this myself, most effective to recognise later that my contribution turned into now no longer following the hints of the project.
   
2. <b>Ask all the questions</b>
   
   One of the maximum superb characteristics of maximum OSS initiatives is that they're complete of beneficial and alluring individuals, in case you are uncertain approximately a way to put into effect a extrade or wherein your paintings may be the maximum impactful take a look at the project’s conversation channels. Most initiatives have a discourse instance, slack channel, or spectrum room to assist solution questions from customers and could be contributors.

3. <b>Do checks on your work and then check your work again</b>

   Imagine the submission of your difficulty or pull request as critical as a piece assignment.

   - Focus your paintings. Starting small will supply your contributions a higher risk to be accepted
   - Write descriptive and succinct dedicate messages
   - Do your tests, then test your paintings again
   
4. <b>Be patient and open to feedback</b>
 
   Remember, the oldsters running in this initiatives additionally have full-time jobs and existence obligations. Be patient, provide time on your contributions to be reviewed, and be open to feedback.

   And finally, live encouraged. Maybe your first contribution changed into now no longer regular or the network wasn’t the maximum welcoming. Keep attempting and gaining knowledge of from the experience, or discover every other challenge you're similarly interested by and that is probably a higher match.
