*Step 2*-

Then join the FOSSASIA org on GitHub through this linke here.


*Step 3*-

Each developer then searches for issues labeled Codeheat that interests them and claims ownership of a particular issue. The developer works on the issue and if there are questions asks on the chat channel of the project. The main channel for decision making is however always the GitHub issue itself.

*Step 4*-

Once finished, the developers make a pull request from his/her own forked repository to the development branch of the project and submit their work for review.


*Step 5*-

Pull requests need to pass Travis builds, code CI tests and ensure migrations work.


*Step 6*-

Mentors and maintainers from the organization evaluate the work submitted. If the work is accepted, the developer earns 1 point for each accepted pull request and 1 point if they close an issue. So you could earn two points if you close an issue with a pull requests. 

*Please Note*: Sometimes developers try to “beat the system” by submitting lots of small improvements as pull requests. Please consider that the jury is mainly interested in the substantiality and quality of code contributions and the sheer number is not the main criteria.

*Step 7*-
After the pull request has been merged developers can claim another issue to work on if they wish.


*Step 8*-
If the work needs polishing, the task remains open and the core-developer may give the submitter additional time and guidance on improving their work.


*Step 9*-
If the work does not meet expectations, the task can be reopened for another developer contestant to claim and work on.
