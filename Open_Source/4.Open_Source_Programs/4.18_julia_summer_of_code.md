# Everything Related to  `Julia Summer of Code`
Julia Summer of Code now also known as Julia Seasons of Contributions (JSoC) are the seasonal programs for funding and/or mentoring students and other developers to contribute to the open source ecosystem. Below are the current programs that the Julia Language is participating in.

 1. Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
 2. Google Season of Docs (GSoD)
 3. NumFOCUS Small Development Grants
 4. Summer 2021 Open Source Promotion Plan
 
Now we will discuss about these programs and the role of Julia in them-:

## [Google Summer of Code(GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)

The Julia organization is a participant in Google Summer of Code. The Julia organization generally fields a large number of students (>20) mentored by open source developers and university professors at leading institutions from all around the world. Students who are accepted into this prestigious program are paid a summer stipend to contribute to the open source tooling around Julia and its package ecosystem.

Check out the [application guidelines](https://julialang.org/jsoc/guidelines/) once you have a project in mind.

You can see previous Summer of Code projects at the [Archive page](https://julialang.org/jsoc/archive/) and details around the mentoring process on the [Mentors page](https://julialang.org/jsoc/mentors/).

The Julia organization applies to participate in [Google's Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs). The Julia organization generally fields a large number of students mentored by open source developers, university professors at leading institutions from all around the world, and technical writers in the Julia Community. Students who are accepted into this prestigious program are paid a stipend to contribute open source documentation to Julia and its package ecosystem.

## [NumFOCUS Small Development Grants](https://numfocus.org/programs/small-development-grants)
![NumFOCUS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35577566/114047420-87487880-983e-11eb-83f1-2820cfe17942.png)

Semi-quarterly NumFOCUS puts out a call for small development grants. The Julia language organization puts out a call for proposals from the community for grant proposals. There are no restrictions on what the funding can be used for. Code development, documentation work, educational, sustainability, and diversity initiatives, or other types of projects are all eligible.

Since only one application can be put in for the Julia project, an internal selection process is used to determine which proposals will be submitted to NumFOCUS. For examples of grants that were funded in the first round, [previous awards](https://numfocus.org/programs/sustainability#sdg).

Usually, around USD 3,000 - 5,000 is available per proposal. The total allocated funding from NumFOCUS is around USD 20,000 - 50,000 in previous cycles, meaning that not every project will be able to receive a grant. This total amount is adjusted depending on the number and quality of proposals.

Impotant dates for current year Small Development Grants are:

-   May 7th, 2021 - Round 2 call for proposals goes live.
-   June 4th, 2021 - Round 2 proposal deadline.
-   July 15th, 2021 - Round 2 notification of application status.
-   August 6th, 2021 - Round 3 call for proposals goes live.
-   September 3rd, 2021 - Round 3 proposal deadline.
-   October 15th, 2021 - Round 3 notification of application status.

Similar to GSoC, the Open Source Promotion Plan aims to promote the development of open source software and facilitate the construction of excellent open source software community. The Julia community is also a partner this year. Students who are interested in this program can take look at the Julia related [project list](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/#/org/orgdetail/julia) and contact the mentor. For project owners who would like to submit new proposals, please contact [Jun Tian](mailto:tianjun.cpp@gmail.com).

## Program Admins

The JSoC (encompasses GSoC, GSoD, etc.) program admins have a few responsibilities including, but not limited too, reviewing student applications for all programs, creating and submitting the organization application for each program, helping ensure the programs run smoothly, recruiting mentors, making final student selections and more.

## Questions?

For any questions, please consult the program administrators at  `jsoc@julialang.org`. Note that if you are a prospective applicant for one of the programs above, your first step should be to check out the resources for the project you are interested.
