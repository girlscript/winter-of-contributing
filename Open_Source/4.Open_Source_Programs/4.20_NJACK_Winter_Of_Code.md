NWOC (NJACK Winter of Code) is a program by NJACK (The Official Computer Science Club of IIT Patna) that helps students understand the paradigm of Open Source contribution and gives them real world software development exposure.

## ABOUT THE PROGRAM

NWOC is an initiative by NJACK, IIT Patna, targeted at students who have never participated in Free or Open Source Software (FOSS) development before, as well as at those who have already become an expert in Open Source Development and are currently contributing to projects of any domain, say Web, Mobile, Machine Learning, Blockchain, IoT etc. It also aims to prepare them for bigger programs and opportunities like Google Summer of Code, Outreachy etc.

## How it works?

Participants can apply for the program either as a student or as a mentor. Mentors are selected through a selection process. The selected mentors propose projects, the best of which are chosen to be included in the program. Students work on these projects in their winter vacations. The mentors review the pull requests and the overall work on their project by various contributors throughout the coding period of the program. At the end of the coding period, the students are compared on the basis of most contributions.
