India is home to one of the world's largest communities of student programmers. In 2020, the number of students participating in the GitHub Campus program increased by 142%,
over 100,000 students signed up for the GitHub Student Developer Pack, and more than 100 higher-education institutions in India embraced the campus offering.

This expansion is encouraging, as the student ecosystem is critical to India's sustained growth and innovation pace. Students, on the other hand, do not have enough opportunity
to receive mentorship that will prepare them for the real world and improve their employment prospects.

Github developed GitHub Externships to help and meet the needs of this growing community of student engineers. This adds to the GitHub Campus offering by giving students a 
one-of-a-kind opportunity to engage with Indian companies through fellowship programs and develop the skills that future developers will need to succeed in an industrial setting.
The program truly ties open source, the next generation of software developers, and successful businesses together.

Collaborate on open source projects from corporations to get a taste of what it's like to address real-world IT problems.

The GitHub Externship is a 90-day fellowship program for GitHub Campus Partner students in their third or pre-final year. The GitHub Externship program focuses on studying, 
preparing students for the job market, fostering industry-academic relationships, and providing students with practical experience. This initiative seeks to provide partner 
companies with new solutions to their current difficulties as well as assisting them in identifying true talent that may be employed at a later date.

- **Organization Administrator:** Organization administrator will submit the organization’s application to participate in the program to GitHub/IncubateIND, ensure that mentors 
fill out evaluations in a timely fashion, and align their project’s participation in GitHub Externship. The org admin acts as GitHub’s go-to person, if any issues arise. 
Org admins are the final authority about matters such as which student projects will be accepted and who will mentor whom.

- **Mentor:** Mentors are people from the community who volunteer to work with a student. Mentors provide guidance such as pointers to useful documentation, code reviews, etc. 
In addition to providing students with feedback and pointers, a mentor acts as an ambassador to help student contributors integrate into their project’s community.

- **Student:** Student participants will be college student of third or pre-final year (B.E/B.Tech, MSc, MCA & BCA) in one of the GitHub Campus Program Partner Schools,
who will submit project proposals to the various organizations participating in GitHub Externship.

## Eligiblity

Because GitHub wanted to provide a platform for GitHub partner schools to communicate with the industry and address real-world challenges, it is presently limited to GitHub Campus Program schools. 
The GitHub Campus Program partner schools, having been trained on the GitHub platform and open source, will be better able to adapt to the open source environment and relate to the difficulties
in a more meaningful way. GitHub is committed to bringing more schools to the forefront and training students on the GitHub platform and open source so that more students can
participate in future GitHub Externship editions.
