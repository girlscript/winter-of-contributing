# What is MLH Fellowship?

Major League Hacking (MLH) is an international student development community that began in 2013. It organises events such as career fests, workshops, and hackathons to help a 
large number of student developers and engineers all around the world.
When COVID-19 hit and a pandemic broke out throughout the world, the IT industry took the brunt of the damage. Many organisations were not set up for remote work, and students, 
particularly those searching for summer and fall internships, were the ones who suffered the most. During this difficult time, Major League Hacking (MLH) devised a Fellowship 
Program that offered hope to students seeking real-world experience among the upheaval.

The MLH Fellowship is a 12-week internship that seeks to provide students real-world experience by allowing them to contribute to open-source projects. 
Mike Swift, CEO and Co-Founder of MLH, hailed the fellowship as "The Future of Tech" during Github Universe.
