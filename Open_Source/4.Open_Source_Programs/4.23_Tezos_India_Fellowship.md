The Tezos India Fellowship is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn how to create on the bleeding edge of blockchain technology. 30 committed fellows will have access to 
the top mentors in the ecosystem, as well as all of the resources they require.

Over the course of an 8-week mentor-led program, the top developers in India will be coached and assisted in learning and then building on the Tezos stack while getting a 
$2000 stipend.

Here are some reasons why you should apply for the Tezos India Fellowship:
- **Learn, Grow & Contribute to Open Source:** Contributing to open source projects is not only personally rewarding, but it also develops important skills for being a 
well-rounded developer.
- **Get rewarded for your efforts:** Apart from evaluation for higher grants at the end of the program, a stipend of $2000 will be granted over the course of the program 
based on milestones accomplished.
- **Get mentored by Industry Leaders:** Tezos attracts the ecosystem's brightest minds, who will guide and mentor you as you explore the ecosystem.
- **Join a global community:** This will be an excellent opportunity to interact closely with important stakeholders in the tight-knit Tezos community, which could 
lead to more exciting internship, full-time job, or perhaps funding for the next major Dapp.

## How will it work?

- To make your case for joining the fellowship, fill out the form for it. Once you've received your conditional acceptance and been invited to the fellowship, schedule a remote interview.
- Over the course of eight weeks, work directly with the mentors to learn, perfect your talents, and contribute to the Tezos ecosystem. The weekly time commitment is anticipated to be 40 hours.
- Weekly milestones must be met under the supervision of your mentor in order to be eligible for stipend distributions every two weeks. The programme will conclude with a grant evaluation for future funding.
