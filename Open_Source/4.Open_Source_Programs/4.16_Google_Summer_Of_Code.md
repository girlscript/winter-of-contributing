We all have come across GSOC either when we start our open source journey or a developer journey you think you have some general idea about it but you want to know more lets try to understand all the fuss about GSOC today

## What is GSOC ?

The Google Summer of Code, often abbreviated to GSoC, is an international annual program in which Google awards stipends to students who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer. It is held annually in the summer months of a year, where students who are above the age of eighteen and enrolled in a university are supposed to complete a software coding project. Students partner with mentors to gain exposure into real world software development.

## Eligibility
You must be a student and you have to be above 18 years and enrolled in a university. If you have a student ID card, you are eligible.

## Why Should I Apply?
 
There are many reasons you should apply to GSOC. I will try to list a few of them. In just one summer, you will take your programming and communication skills to a whole new level. You will build your network, interact with some of the most extraordinary people in the field. Hey, if you have done fantastic requirements, might be offered a job or invited for an internship by the members of your community or offered a chance to present your work at a conference if this hasnâ€™t convinced you you will be earning a stipend from Google. The amount of compensation depends on the country of your origin.
