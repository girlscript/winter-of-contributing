## How OpenCode works 
### Step 1 : Claim Issue
The set of available issues will be posted in the **Issues** tab of the GitHub repository.
Once you've gone through the issue, understand the requirements of the issue, and make sure that you don't choose a topic that is too high for your level. Usually in Open Source events there is a massive number of people who want to contribute, and you'll have a time constraint to solve that issue
It is advisable to choose a topic/issue which slighty higher than your level, by doing so you will learn something new and will also be able to solve the issue in time

### Step 2 : Solve Issue
Once the issue is assigned to you, research about the topic and understand it enough to solve the issue.You can continue to learn about more ways on how to proceed once you have a basic solution for the issue what works

### Step 3 : Open a Pull Request
Once you have solved the issue, make sure to run any unit tests (that check the basic functionalities of the project, whether the new additions to the code base has caused any bugs!!) that have been mentioned in the repository
Now it's time to merge these changes to the main repository. You can do this by creating a **Pull Request** (A request to the code maintainer, to approve the changes that you've made to the repository and officially merge the changes)

### Step 4 : Check the Leaderboard
This is the place where you can see how many contributions are taking place in the event. Everyone who creates a pull request can join the leaderbord and see where they stand (positive competition).
