# What is GirlScript Summer of Code?

Girlscript Summer Of Code is a 3-month long open source project under Girlscript India. In this Summer Of Code, all the registered participants would get an exquisite opportunity to interact with the mentors and the Organizing Team from 24th February 2021 to 28th February 2021.In this period they can extract any help or can resolve any  sort of query or uncertainty that they might be having regarding the projects or itâ€™s implementation. The team and the mentors will endeavour to provide the required help from their best possible resources. From 1st March onwards, the mentors will be declaring  the issues of the Open Source Projects and the admins will be looking after the final structuring of the websites. If a participant is willing to work on a project, he/she will have to comment on the issue and make a pull request and if the mentor finds the work satisfactory, the participant would get the opportunity to work for the same.

<br>
The claiming of issues by the participants will be on a first come-first served basis. The participants would be continuously evaluated on all the projects that they contribute to and thereby the  mentors will have to maintain a leaderboard and submit a biweekly evaluation of their respective mentees.

## How GSSoC works?

How does GSSoC work, you ask? It's quite simple. In layman's terms, multiple people apply to register their project under the banner of GSSoC, the owners (called Project Admins) of the projects that are accepted than are assigned a bunch of mentors (usually 2-3) who are tasked to help the Admins throughout the three months. Participants can contribute to these projects and earn points, and now you know where I am going with this, prizes are distributed based on points earned yadda yadda yadda.

## How to choose a project?

Before choosing a project, we need to ask ourselves a few questions:

What languages, tech stack, framework. Am I proficient in? None is also acceptable, to be honest.
What languages, tech stack, framework. I want to learn/master or at least get the hang of it after these three months?
The best part about GSSoC is the number of projects that one can choose from; with nearly 100 projects using various tech stacks to select from, GSSoC has something for everyone. Fond of Web development, multiple projects are using MERN, MEAN, MEVN, ROR stack. Love Machine learning and Deep Learning, there are projects which specifically focus on classification and prediction. Love Python? Do take a look at multiple Flask and Django projects. Willing to master DS and Algo, GSSoC has got you covered. From beginners to advanced, you will for sure find something. You don't the coding and debugging part? How about Documentation? Nearly every project needs that.
