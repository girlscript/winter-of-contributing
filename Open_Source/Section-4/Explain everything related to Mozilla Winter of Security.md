The Winter of Security (MWOS) is a program organized by Mozilla's Security teams to involve students with Security projects. Students who have to perform a semester project as part of their university curriculum can apply to one of the MWOS project. Projects are guided by a Mozilla Adviser, and a University Professor. Students are graded by their University, based on success criteria identified at the beginning of the project. Mozilla Advisers allocate up to 2 hours each week to their students, typically on video-conference, to discuss progress and roadblocks.

Projects are focused on building security tools, and students are expected to write code which must be released as Open Source. Universities are free to specify their own requirements to projects, such as written reports. Mozilla does not influence the way grades are allocated, but advisers will provide any information professors need in order to grade their students.

## Selection Process
Selection process
Projects are assigned to groups of students. Groups are defined by the universities, and can be of any size between 1 and 4 students. The selection process is open to all students in undergraduate/license and graduate/master programs. A group applies to up to 3 projects by submitting an application that contains:

- The names of the projects the team is applying to
team introduction and motivation (max 1000 characters)
- Presentation of the university program (max 500 characters)
- Short description of each team member (skills, interest, ...) (max 500 character for each team member)
- Links to relevant resources (university website, resumes, ...)
