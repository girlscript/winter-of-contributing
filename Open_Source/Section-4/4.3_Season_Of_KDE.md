# What is Season of KDE?

Started in 2013, Season of KDE is a community outreach program that has been hosted by the KDE community as a program similar to, but not quite the same as Google Summer of Code, offering an opportunity to everyone 
(not just students) to participate in both code and non-code projects that benefits the KDE ecosystem.
Through the Season of KDE, the participant gets familiar and comfortable with the KDEâ€™s codebase and documentation.
In the past few years, SoK participants have not only contributed new application features but have also developed the KDE Continuous Integration System, statistical reports for 
developers, a web framework, ported KDE Applications, created documentation and lots and lots of other work.

Season of KDE program spans about 3 months and student application and mentor application submission begins around December. The first month of the program is given to communicating period where students exchange ideas with the expected mentor, through IRCs and mailing lists and mentor verifies the feasibility of the idea.

- <strong>Before Drafting Proposal</strong> - You should choose your favorite KDE project that you will like to help improve through your contributions, be it the KDE web framework, Plasma Mobile, Desktop based KDE projects like Krita, Kdenlive, etc or even KDE Documents. Each project has its own repository where many beginner-friendly issues and bugs are available to help the participant get started with contributing to KDE.
- <strong>Drafting Proposal</strong> - The proposal should primarily focus on the problem at hand, the project topic, and a basic idea of how they plan to solve it. The proposal should mention about the past contributions to KDE to ensure the mentors that the participants have basic knowledge of the project before the SoK begins.
- <strong>Getting Selected</strong> - Once the participant submits a proposal, they will be selected by their respective project mentors. The selected participants then begin their respective projects and work to complete it within the specified timeline and The participants have to stay in constant touch with their mentors and keep the KDE community updated with their progress through weekly or biweekly blog posts in the official KDE blog page and updating their respective status report pages.
