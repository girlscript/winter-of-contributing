    "\n",
    "This is one of the most awaited and big contest where developers take part and work on many Github repositories offered by Fossasia throughout it's journey.\n",
    "The idea of the contest is to introduce developers to the FOSSASIA projects and to provide an opportunity to build up their development profile, learn how to work according to Best Development Practices and ultimately become part of the development team. The contest also provides an entry point and preparation for future coding programs like the FOSSASIA Google Summer of Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many young developers are not yet deeply familiar with Open Source and the contest is an easy way to get involved in this international community of developers, who want to help you learn and succeed. The contest is a gateway to learning new skills as well as learning to work in a collaborative software development team. At the end of the contest, developers can show their friends, teachers, co-developers and family members the work they did on public repositories and the project applications itself - used by people around the world.\n",
    "Fossasia encourages to build up Projects with collaboration as well as individual to increase the experience in Open source and level up your profile with Fossasia.\n",

Please consider that the jury is mainly interested in the substantiality and quality of code contributions and the sheer number is not the main criteria.]\n",
