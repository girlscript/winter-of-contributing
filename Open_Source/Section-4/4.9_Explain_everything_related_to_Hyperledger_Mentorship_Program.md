## Program Description
The Hyperledger mentorship program is aimed at creating a structured hands-on learning opportunity for new developers who may otherwise lack the opportunity to gain exposure to Hyperledger open source development and entry to the technical community. It also provides a more defined path for Hyperledger to connect with the next generation of student developers to inject more talent into its development community. Each mentee will apply and be matched with a mentor or mentors who are active developers in the Hyperledger community. Each mentee will work remotely from his/her location of choice. Regular evaluation and feedback will be provided. Mentees may have the opportunity to travel to a Hyperledger conference/event to meet their peers and mentors face-to-face and to present their work to the broader community.<br/>

## Eligibility

**Mentee Applicant Eligibility**

- You must be at least 18 years of age by end of May.

- The mentorship will be remote. However, you must be eligible to work in the country and jurisdiction where you reside in for the entire duration of the program.
- Please review any additional [eligibility requirements](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentee-guide/am-i-eligible) that may apply.

# How to Apply

Application Steps</br> 
## Step 1: review eligibility<br/>
The Hyperlegder Mentorship Program is aimed at providing a structured and guided learning opportunity for new developers, including college and university students, interested in becoming open source contributors to the Hyperledger community. Please first review the [eligibility requirements](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentee-guide/am-i-eligible) to determine if you're eligible to apply. 

## Step 2: discover projects

Carefully review the Hyperledger mentorship projects that are open for applications in year and identify which project(s) you're interested in.

- Ask yourself which projects you are the most excited or curious about exploring? The project descriptions, learning objectives and outcomes, and any additional information or links on the project page may give you some insight. 
- Ask yourself which projects are a better fit for your profile. Be sure to read about the educational level and skills required or desired to evaluate if you are qualified.
- Lastly, some mentorships require Summer FT (full-time) commitment (40 hours a week for 12 consecutive weeks from June to August) or Summer PT (part-time) commitment (20 hours a week for 24 consecutive weeks from June to November) while others allow both options. Make sure the program timeline and schedule will fit into your schedule. 
Each applicant may apply for multiple but no more than THREE projects. We recommend that you focus your effort on 2 projects and submit a quality application for those two projects.   

## Step 3: contact mentor(s)

This step is optional. Feel free to contact the mentor(s) for the projects that you are interested in to learn more and to clarify any information that's unclear to you.

- You may be able to discover more about the desirable background and skills of the mentee the mentor(s) are looking to work with.
- We have learned that the best applications are often from students who took the time to interact and discuss their ideas with the mentors before submitting an application.
- But be thoughtful with your questions as our mentors may be receiving a large volume of questions from interested applicants.

## Step 4: prepare application materials

Besides collecting standard demographic and contact information on the application, we will ask you to upload your resume and a cover letter.The cover letter will ask you to address the following questions:

- How did you find out about our program?
- Why are you interested in the project(s) you're applying to?
- What experience and knowledge/skills do you have that are applicable to the requirements of the project(s) you're applying to?
- What do you hope to get out of this experience?
- Remember, your cover letter should demonstrate not only you're qualified but also passionate about becoming an active contributor in the Hyperledger open source community - through this experience. 

## Step 5: apply on LFX Mentorship Platform

LFX Mentorship, developed by The Linux Foundation, of which Hyperledger is part of, is the portal where the Hyperledger mentorship projects are listed and mentee applications will be taken.

 - Go to [LFX Mentorship Platform](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/#projects_all)
- Create Your Mentee Profile (you will need to create an [LFID first](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/sso/create-an-account) you don't already have one
- View all projects and search by "Hyperledger" to see all 22 Hyperledger projects open for application
- Click on the specific Hyperledger projects to read about the project details
- Be sure to "View Site" to take you to the corresponding wiki page for complete project information
- When ready, click "Apply" (remember you can apply up to 3 projects)
-Complete the application prerequisites: latest resume and cover letter
- Please review detailed application instructions that may further assist your application on LFX Mentorship.

## Mentee Stipend and Travel Funding

Mentees will be eligible to receive a stipend. The total stipend amount will be calculated using a tiered structure based on the country where the mentee resides when participating in the program. The stipend will be paid in installments provided that regular interval evaluations show the intern is making satisfactory progress. The final installment will be paid upon successful project completion.

Mentees who successfully complete the program may be invited and financially sponsored by Hyperledger to attend a technical event and present their work to the broader community (specific event TBD depending on the event schedule but will be during Q3 or Q4 of the program year or Q1 of the following year).

## Summer FT (Full-Time) Mentee Schedule

Full time program requires the commitment of 40 hours per week for 12 consecutive weeks from a mentee and this option is recommended for those who do not have other significant commitment such as school or work from June to August to dedicate full time to working on the internship project. 

- June 1: official start date
 - June 18: 1st Quarter Evaluation at the end of week 3
- July 9: Midterm Evaluation at the end of week 6 (midterm stipend will be paid to the mentee if the mentee is in good standing with the mentor following the midterm evaluation)
- July 30: 3rd Quarter Evaluation at the end of week 9
- August 20-31: Final Evaluation upon conclusion of the internship at the end of week 12 (final stipend will be paid to the mentee if the mentor determines that the mentee has successfully completed the internship following the final evaluation)

## Project Proposal

- Project maintainers, active contributors and community members are welcome to submit a mentorship project proposal for consideration.
- Multiple mentors supervising one mentee per project would be desirable as this helps spread the workload and reduce the challenge of coverage caused by working remotely with a mentee in a different time zone.
- The mentor(s) need to be familiar with the project and is/are expected to directly supervise the hired mentee's technical work.

- The proposed project needs to be clearly scoped and structured to be suitable for a mentorship project.

- The project should be related to one of the current Hyperledger Projects or Labs.

- The outcome of the project will benefit the existing Hyperledger Projects or Labs or advance the Hyperledger open source technical community's work at large.  
- The mentor(s) should be ready to be the sponsor of the mentorship project as a Hyperleger Lab when the mentorship commences. This ensures that the project progress can be tracked and the project output can be publicly accessible to the community.

## Proposal Review/Selection Process and Criteria
