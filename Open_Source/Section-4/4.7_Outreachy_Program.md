## What is Outreachy Program?
Outreachy is a three-month-long internship program which is organized by the Software Freedom Conservancy for the people who are underrepresented in this specific field. It is a
paid and remote internship, and it is conducted twice a year that is from May to August and December to March. In the Outreachy program, you will get to contribute to open source
so if you are familiar to open source then this will increase your chances of getting shortlisted for the program. The amount paid as a stipend is around 5500 USD and the
internship completely works from home but if you need to attend any event related to this program then the travel stipend of 500 USD is also available. 

The Outreachy Internship program is not only for programmers or developers, there are lots of opportunities in the Outreachy program for non-technical people too.

## Goal of Outreachy 
The goal of Outreachy is to *"create a positive feedback loop"* that supports more women participating in free and open-source software, since contributors to free and open-source
projects have mostly been men. The program is similar to Google Summer of Code, also an internship in free and open-source software, but unlike Google Summer of Code it is not 
limited to students or developers. It is intended to be compatible with student schedules, with mid-year internships corresponding with the summer break of students in the 
northern hemisphere, and late-year internships corresponding with the summer break of students in the southern hemisphere.

The program began with inviting women participants, and it grew to include *"anyone who was assigned female at birth and anyone who identifies as a woman, genderqueer, genderfluid,
or genderfree regardless of gender presentation"*.


## Application Process
**1. Initial Application Period:** There is mainly essay-type questions where they generally ask about your thoughts about diversity in work and present challenges and you will
have to answer questions that will aim to test your dedication to the program, so you should answer to show that you are eager to learn and completely committed to the program.

**2. Contribution Period:** It is mainly about making open source contributions. The final selection of candidates depends upon the quality of contribution they make during the
contribution period. The candidates will get to interact with the mentors during the contribution period.

**3. Intern Selection Period:** Here, the mentors analyze the work of the applicants and verify their project timeline according to their contributions and commitment and then
the mentors give reports to Outreachy organizers of all the selected candidates.
