<h1 align="center"> CrossPlane </h1>

<hr>

Crossplane is a multicloud control plane that is open source. On top of existing managed services, it adds workload and resource abstractions, allowing for significant workload portability between 
cloud providers. Provisioning and full-lifecycle administration of services and infrastructure across a wide range of providers, offerings, vendors, geographies, and clusters are made 
possible by a single crossplane. Crossplane provides a cloud computing universal API, a task scheduler, and a collection of smart controllers for automating work across clouds. 
Crossplane is a declarative management API that supports a wide range of portable abstractions such as databases, message queues, buckets, data pipelines, serverless, clusters,
and more. It's built on top of the prominent Kubernetes project's declarative resource model, and it extends many of the lessons learnt in container orchestration to multicloud 
workload and resource orchestration.

Crossplane is a declarative management API that supports a wide range of portable abstractions such as databases, message queues, buckets, data pipelines, serverless, clusters,
and more. It's built on top of the prominent Kubernetes project's declarative resource model, and it extends many of the lessons learnt in container orchestration to multicloud workload and resource orchestration.

The project encourages developers and administrators to keep their concerns separate. Workloads are defined by developers without regard for implementation details, 
environment limitations, or policies. Administrators can set policies and environment specifics.

It features a workload scheduler that may consider a variety of factors when deploying workloads and their resources, including capabilities, availability, dependability, cost, geographies, and performance. 
The scheduler collaborates with specialised resource controllers to guarantee that administrators' policies are followed.

## Why was Crossplane created?

Upbound's goal is to build a more open cloud computing platform with more options and less lock-in. A control plane is at the heart of every cloud, and we hope that 
Crossplane can serve as the open cloud's control plane. Anyone can extend an open control plane to manage commercial or open-source cloud services and resources by adding 
additional APIs and controllers. It serves as a central point of integration for many services as well as a foundation for a more open ecosystem of applications and tools.

Crossplane is a community-driven project, and we're launching it early in the hopes of enlisting the help of the open source community in making multicloud a reality.

## Crossplane Providers Available Today

All of the major cloud providers are supported by Crossplane, and the community is always looking for additional ones. The following suppliers are now available:

- Alibaba Cloud
- AWS
- Equinix
- Google Cloud Platform
- IBM Cloud
- Microsoft Azure
- Red Hat
- Terraform
- VMware

## Crossplane Community

The community has grown tremendously since the initial publication of the Crossplane project in 2018. We've seen folks from all over the world discover the project and 
empathise with the pain problems it addresses, said Daniel Mangum, a maintainer of the Crossplane project, a senior software engineer at Upbound, and a member of the 
Crossplane Community Day programme committee. These people and organisations have banded together to help shape the future of technology while also creating an open and 
inclusive community. Crossplane's maturity has been particularly visible in the recent year, as evidenced by its contribution to the CNCF, the publication of a stable v1.0 
version, and widespread adoption in enterprise settings.
