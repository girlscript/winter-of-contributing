Docker has quite an amount of buzz around it today because it makes so many things easy that were difficult with virtual machines.Docker containers makes it easy for Developers, Systems Administrators, Architects, Consultants and others to quickly test a piece of software in a container; much quicker than a virtual machine, and using less resources. The average command in Docker 
takes under a second to complete.
Docker is an open source platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized
applications.

## **About docker**
Docker is a software platform for building applications based on containers small and lightweight execution environments that make shared use of the operating system kernel but otherwise run in isolation from one another. While containers have been used in Linux and Unix systems for some time, Docker, an open source project launched in 2013, helped popularize the technology by making it easier than ever for developers to package their software to “build once and run anywhere.”

## **Why use docker?**
Docker enables developers to easily pack, ship, and run any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container, 
which can run virtually anywhere. Docker containers provide a way to get a grip on software. You can use Docker to wrap up an application in such a way 
that its deployment and runtime issues—how to expose it on a network, how to manage its use of storage and memory and I/O, how to control access permissions—are 
handled outside of the application itself, and in a way that is consistent across all “containerized” apps. You can run your Docker container on any OS-compatible 
host (Linux or Windows) that has the Docker runtime installed.

## **Importance of Docker?**
Docker is so popular today that “Docker” and “containers” are used interchangeably. But the first container-related technologies were available for years, even decades before Docker was released to the public in 2013. 
<br>
Docker enhanced the native Linux containerization capabilities with technologies that enable:
- Improved and seamless portability
- Even lighter weight and more granular updates
- Automated container creation
- Container versioning
- Container reuse
- Shared container libraries

## **Docker tools**
- **DockerFile :** Every Docker container starts with a simple text file containing instructions for how to build the Docker container image. 
- **Docker images :** Docker images contain executable application source code as well as all the tools, libraries, and dependencies that the application code needs to run as a container.
- **Docker containers :** Docker containers are the live, running instances of Docker images. While Docker images are read-only files, containers are live, ephemeral, executable content. 
- **Docker Hub :** Docker Hub is the public repository of Docker images that is the “world’s largest library and community for container images.” It holds over 100,000 container images sourced from commercial software vendors, open-source projects, and individual developers.
- **Docker daemon :** Docker daemon is a service running on your operating system, such as Microsoft Windows or Apple MacOS or iOS. 
- **Docker registry :** A Docker registry is a scalable open-source storage and distribution system for docker images.
