# Docker
- Open Platform for developing, packing and running applications.
- It helps in separating the applications from the infrastructure to deliver the software quickly.
- Basically, Reduce the delay  between writing code and running it in production.

## Features
- It comprises of loosely isolated environment called as container.
- Isolation and Security allows us to run many containers simultaneously on a given host.

####    **What is container?**

Containers are light weight environments and consists of everything needed to run the applications, So you don't rely on what is currently on the host. It supports the components of the application that we want to develop. The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing our application.

## Using Docker 

- Docker helps in development life cycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environment using local containers which provide applications and services.
- Developers can write code locally and share their work with others using Docker Containers.
- You can push your application to test a environment and execute manual and automated tests.
- bugs found can be fixed in development environment and redeploy them to the test environment for testing and validation.
- Docker containers can run on a developer’s local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments.
- It can dynamically manage workload. So it is preferred in high density environments and also fits for small and medium deployments wherewe require fewer resources.

## Docker Architecture

![Docker Architecture](https://docs.docker.com/engine/images/architecture.svg "Text to show on mouseover")
- It uses Client-Server Architecture Model.
- The Docker client talks to Docker daemon, which does heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers.
- The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. 
- The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. 
- Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.

If you don't know what is Daemon then, understand it as a computer program that runs as a background process and it is ready to perform an operation whenever required.

Let's Understand actual flow of instructions :
- Docker daemon listens to Docker API requests and manages objects.
- Docker Client is the way users interacts with Docker. When you run ```docker``` commands it uses docker API and client can them communicate with more than one Daemon.
- Docker registry stores docker images.


## Tech Stack

- Docker is written in the **Go programming language** and takes advantage of several features of the **Linux kernel** to deliver its functionality.
- Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container. When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.

# Project Demo

## Installation and Setup

- First of all we are supposed to Install Docker Engine. It is available for all Operating systems. 

But here we will be looking for Linux Platforms (**Ubuntu Focal 20.04** to be more specific). You can find about your OS from official site https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/


Note : Plz know that we are following Ubuntu guide. You must refer official site if you have different Operating System.

---

## Installation Method

You can install Docker Engine in different ways, depending on your needs:

- Most users set up Docker’s repositories and install from them, for ease of installation and upgrade tasks. This is the recommended approach.

- Some users download the DEB package and install it manually and manage upgrades completely manually. This is useful in situations such as installing Docker on air-gapped systems with no access to the internet.

- In testing and development environments, some users choose to use automated convenience scripts to install Docker.

Here We will follow Install using Repository Method !
- Step 1 : Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS


```Bash
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

- Step 2 : Add Docker’s official GPG key (Please Key as per your OS)
```Bash
$curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

- Step 3 : Use the following command to set up the stable repository.
```Bash 
$echo \
  "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

- Step 4 : Use the following command locate your docker engine on your system files.
```Bash
$sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

-Step 5 : Run the following command and check if everything worked well with your installation.

```Bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

You should expect this as your output :

### Let's Build Project.
We will be making a simple python web application running on Docker Compose. We shall use Flask framework and implement hit counter in Redis. It will increment the number of times you the page.

###  Step 1 : Setup

1. Create a directory for project.
```Bash
$mkdir GWOC_OS_Docker
$cd GWOC_OS_Docker
```
2. Create a file ```app.py``` and paste below code in it.

```Python
import time

import redis
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379)

def get_hit_count():
    retries = 5
    while True:
        try:
            return cache.incr('hits')
        except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
            if retries == 0:
                raise exc
            retries -= 1
            time.sleep(0.5)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    count = get_hit_count()
    return 'Welcome to GWOC OpenSource Docker Learning! I have been seen {} times.\nContributed by Harshil-Jani'.format(count)
```

In this example, ```redis``` is the hostname of the redis container on the application’s network. We use the default port for Redis, ```6379```.

3. Create another file called requirements.txt in your project directory and paste this in:
```text
flask
redis
```

### Step 2 : Create a Dockerfile

In this step, you write a Dockerfile that builds a Docker image. The image contains all the dependencies the Python application requires, including Python itself.

In your project directory, create a file named Dockerfile and paste the following:

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM python:3.7-alpine
WORKDIR /code
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev linux-headers
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5000
COPY . .
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```
This tells Docker to:

- Build an image starting with the Python 3.7 image.
- Set the working directory to /code.
- Set environment variables used by the flask command.
- Install gcc and other dependencies
- Copy requirements.txt and install the Python dependencies.
- Add metadata to the image to describe that the container is listening on port 5000
- Copy the current directory . in the project to the workdir . in the image.
- Set the default command for the container to flask run.

### Step 3 : Define services in a Compose File

Create a file called docker-compose.yml in your project directory and paste the following:

```yml
version: "3.3"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```
This Compose file defines two services: web and redis.

### Step 4 : Build and run you app with Compose

1. From your project directory, start up your application by running docker-compose up.

```Bash
$sudo apt instal
$sudo docker-compose up
```
2. Visit your local host at port 5000 from link given in the terminal window

The Initial Output seems like this :

Every time you refresh the site the number counter increases

Yayy !! If you followed the guide then you have succesfully deployed your first docker project.
