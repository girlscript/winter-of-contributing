 <p align="center">A database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL</p>

 <p align="justify">Vitess is a database solution for deploying, scaling and managing large clusters of open-source database instances. It currently supports MySQL, Percona and MariaDB. It’s architected to run as effectively in a public or private cloud architecture as it does on dedicated hardware. It combines and extends many important SQL features with the scalability of a NoSQL database. Vitess can help you with the following problems:

- Scaling a SQL database by allowing you to shard it, while keeping application changes to a minimum.
- Migrating from baremetal to a private or public cloud.
- Deploying and managing a large number of SQL database instances.
  
Vitess includes compliant JDBC and Go database drivers using a native query protocol. Additionally, it implements the MySQL server protocol which is compatible with virtually any other language.

**Vitess served all YouTube database traffic for over five years.** Many enterprises have now adopted Vitess for their production needs. YouTube is not the only major tech firm using Vitess internally. Other notable adopters include Slack Technologies Inc., HubSpot Inc., Pinterest Inc. and Square Inc., etc</p>
