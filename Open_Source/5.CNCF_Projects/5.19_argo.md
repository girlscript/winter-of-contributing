Argo is an open source suite of projects that helps developers deliver software more rapidly and safely. Kubernetes-native Argo makes it easier for developers to deploy and release their own applications.

Argo tools enable progressive delivery by letting developers define a set of tasks required for shipping and distributing their services.

**Argo Workflows and Pipelines** is a container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes.

**Argo Events** is an event-driven workflow automation framework and dependency manager that helps you manage Kubernetes resources, Argo Workflows, serverless workloads, etc. on events from a variety of sources.

**Argo CD** is a GitOps-based continuous deployment tool for Kubernetes. Configuration logic lives in Git and let developers use the same development, review and approval workflow they already use with Git-based repositories for code. While Argo CD does not do continuous integration, it can integrate with your CI system.

**Argo RolloutS** is a progressive delivery controller created for Kubernetes. Argo Rollouts facilitate progressive deployment techniques for rolling updates, including canary deployments, blue/green deployments, A/B tests and more.

Within a GitOps context, Argo makes application deployment and lifecycle management easier, particularly as the line between developers and operators disappears, because it automates deployment, makes rollbacks easier and is auditable for easier troubleshooting.

# Open Source Tools

## Argo Workflows - What is Argo Workflows?

Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD.

- Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container.
- Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a graph (DAG).
- Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.
- Run CI/CD pipelines natively on Kubernetes without configuring complex software development products.

## Why Argo Workflows?

- Designed from the ground up for containers without the overhead and limitations of legacy VM and server-based environments.
- Cloud agnostic and can run on any Kubernetes cluster.
- Easily orchestrate highly parallel jobs on Kubernetes.
- Argo Workflows puts a cloud-scale supercomputer at your fingertips!

## Argo CD - What is Argo CD?
Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

## Why Argo CD?

Application definitions, configurations, and environments should be declarative and version controlled. Application deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand.


## Argo Rollouts - What is Argo Rollouts?

Argo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller and set of CRDs which provide advanced deployment capabilities such as blue-green, canary, canary analysis, experimentation, and progressive delivery features to Kubernetes.

Argo Rollouts (optionally) integrates with ingress controllers and service meshes, leveraging their traffic shaping abilities to gradually shift traffic to the new version during an update. Additionally, Rollouts can query and interpret metrics from various providers to verify key KPIs and drive automated promotion or rollback during an update.

## Why Argo Rollouts?

The native Kubernetes Deployment Object supports the RollingUpdate strategy which provides a basic set of safety guarantees (readiness probes) during an update. However the rolling update strategy faces many limitations:

- Few controls over the speed of the rollout
- Inability to control traffic flow to the new version
- Readiness probes are unsuitable for deeper, stress, or one-time checks
- No ability to query external metrics to verify an update
- Can halt the progression, but unable to automatically abort and rollback the update
For these reasons, in large scale high-volume production environments, a rolling update is often considered too risky of an update procedure since it provides no control over the blast radius, may rollout too aggressively, and provides no automated rollback upon failures.

## Controller Features

- Blue-Green update strategy
- Canary update strategy
- Fine-grained, weighted traffic shifting
- Automated rollbacks and promotions
- Manual judgement
- Customizable metric queries and analysis of business KPIs
- Ingress controller integration: NGINX, ALB
- Service Mesh integration: Istio, Linkerd, SMI
- Metric provider integration: Prometheus, Wavefront, Kayenta, Web, Kubernetes Jobs

## Argo Events - What is Argo Events?

Argo Events is an event-based dependency manager for Kubernetes which helps you define multiple dependencies from a variety of event sources like webhook, s3, schedules, streams etc. and trigger Kubernetes objects after successful event dependencies resolution.

## Features
- Manage dependencies from a variety of event sources.
- Ability to customize business-level constraint logic for event dependencies resolution.
- Manage everything from simple, linear, real-time dependencies to complex, multi-source, batch job dependencies.
- Ability to extends framework to add your own event source listener.
- Define arbitrary boolean logic to resolve event dependencies.
- CloudEvents compliant.
- Ability to manage event sources at runtime.
