BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software. This is in contrast to copyleft licenses, which have share-alike requirements. The original BSD license was used for its namesake, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system. The original version has since been revised, and its descendants are referred to as modified BSD licenses.

BSD is both a license and a class of license (generally referred to as BSD-like). The modified BSD license (in wide use today) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix. The BSD license is a simple license that merely requires that all code retain the BSD license notice if redistributed in source code format, or reproduce the notice if redistributed in binary format. The BSD license (unlike some other licenses e.g. GPL) does not require that source code be distributed at all.

## **BSD 3-CLAUSE**

 This version has been vetted as an Open source license by the OSI as "The BSD License". This version allows unlimited redistribution for any purpose as long as its copyright notices and the license's disclaimers of warranty are maintained. The license also contains a clause restricting use of the names of contributors for endorsement of a derived work without specific permission. The Free Software Foundation, which refers to the license as the "Modified BSD License", states that it is compatible with the GNU GPL.

 The following is a BSD 3-Clause ("BSD New" or "BSD Simplified") license template. To generate your own license, change the values of OWNER, ORGANIZATION and YEAR from their original values as given here, and substitute your own.

Note: You may omit clause 3 and still be OSD-conformant. Despite its colloquial name "BSD New", this is not the newest version of the BSD license; it was followed by the even newer BSD-2-Clause version, sometimes known as the "Simplified BSD License". On January 9th, 2008 the OSI Board approved BSD-2-Clause, which is used by FreeBSD and others. It omits the final "no-endorsement" clause and is thus roughly equivalent to the MIT License.
