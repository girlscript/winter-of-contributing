## BSD 2-Clause

BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. This contrasts with copyleft licenses, which have reciprocity share-alike requirements.

The original BSD license was used for its namesake, the Berkeley Software Distribution, a Unix-like operating system.

An even more simplified version has come into use, primarily known for its usage in FreeBSD. The BSD 2-Clause License requires that when you use or redistribute software "in source and binary forms, with or without modification", you retain the copyright statement, the list of conditions, and the disclaimer that the software is provided as-is. 

The primary difference between it and the New BSD License is that it omits the non-endorsement clause. It also adds a further disclaimer about views and opinions expressed in the software. The Free Software Foundation, which refers to the license as the FreeBSD License, states that it is compatible with the GNU GPL. In addition, the FSF encourages users to be specific when referring to the license by name, as it does with the modified/new BSD license, to avoid confusion with the original.
