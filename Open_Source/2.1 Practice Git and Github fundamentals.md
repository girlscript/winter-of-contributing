# Practice Git and Github fundamentals

Imagine you are working on a project and you add some code to it that breaks the project and you want to rollback to that point in that before the change was made.
Git facilitates that by acting as a Version control System.

## Issues faced by early developers before git

* Developers had to submit their codes to the `central server` without having copies of their own
* Any changes made to the source code were unknown to the other developers
* There was no communication between any of the developers

## How git changed the scenario

* Every developer has an entire copy of the code on their `local systems`
* Any changes made to the source code can be tracked by others
* There is regular communication between the developers

## What is git?
 
Git is a `version control` system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management in software development:

* Git is used to `track changes` in the source code
* The distributed version control tool is used for source code management
* It allows multiple developers to work together
* It supports non-linear development through its thousands of `parallel branches`

## What is Github

`Github` is a service based upon `git` where people can share their code, contribute to Open Source, etc. 

Imagine you are given a room to do whatever you want to with your accessories , customize our furniture as per you suitability ( each day ) any time. 
Permitted to share the place with some one, bring people to come at your place and party together and you don’t have to pay or rent all this with any bills. 
How cool would that be…!!

Github is a similar space. You have got a free space to put in you code whatever may be your file type - python, java, c, html, js, nodejs…etc. 
You may customize your code any day, any time, any where (having network connection). 
You may allow people / fellow coders to contribute, commit changes to your work. 
Download your project’s code and use it for their work. Follow you and your work and lot more.

## Git vs Github

Git is used to store the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. It allows developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from multiple developers. GitHub facilitates social coding by providing a Web interface to the Git code repository and management tools for collaboration. GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public & private repositories.

## Getting started with git

### Step 0: Install git and create a GitHub account.
### Step 1: Create a local git repository:

When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you'll first create a new repository. To begin, open up a terminal and move to where you want to place the project on your local machine using the cd (change directory) command. For example, if you have a 'projects' folder on your desktop, you'd do something like:

```shell
cd Desktop
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
```

To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the git init command: 

```shell
git init
```
![step 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133319189-952e5922-4606-46c0-8008-cc712a704855.png)

### Step 2: Add a new file to the repo

Go ahead and add a new file to the project, using any text editor you like or running a touch command. `ECHO>> newfile.txt` just creates and saves a blank file named newfile.txt. 

Once you've added or modified files in a folder containing a git repo, git will notice that  the file exists inside the repo. But, git won't track the file unless you explicitly tell it to. Git only saves/manages changes to files that it tracks, so we’ll need to send a command to confirm that yes, we want git to track our new file.

```shell
ECHO>> newfile.txt
dir
```
After creating the new file, you can use the git status command to see which files git knows exist.

```shell
git status
```
What this basically says is, "Hey, we noticed you created a new file called newfile.txt, but unless you use the 'git add' command we aren't going to do anything with it."

### Step 3: Add a file to the staging environment

Add a file to the staging environment using the `git add` command. 

```shell 
git add newfile.txt
```

If you rerun the git status command, you'll see that git has added the file to the staging environment (notice the "Changes to be committed" line). 

```shell 
git status
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133321461-9eee8c07-d5be-4cc7-a7df-e1d04084b229.png)

### Step 4: Create a commit

It's time to create your first commit!

Run the command `git commit -m "Your message about the commit"`

```shell
git commit -m "This is my first commit"
 ```
The message at the end of the commit should be something related to what the commit contains - maybe it's a new feature, maybe it's a bug fix, maybe it's just fixing a typo

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133321900-48192a50-62fa-41d5-8f47-5e8aed3c2dce.png)


### Step 5: Create a new branch

Let's say you are on the primary branch and want to create a new branch to develop your web page. Here's what you'll do: Run `git checkout -b <my branch name>`. This command will automatically create a new branch and then 'check you out' on it, meaning git will move you to that branch, off of the primary branch.

```shell
git checkout -b mynewbranch
```
 
 After running the above command, you can use the `git branch` command to confirm that your branch was created:
 
 ```shell
git branch
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133322576-0f3cb49a-77b4-4852-bf2d-dbd35bf53bbb.png)

### Step 6: Create a new repository on GitHub

To create a new repo on GitHub, log in and go to the GitHub home page. You can find the “New repository” option under the “+” sign next to your profile picture, in the top right corner of the navbar:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133322818-08b51544-2912-4782-ba5c-91e9afc9f05a.png)

After clicking the button, GitHub will ask you to name your repo and provide a brief description:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133323264-a8e26a47-6897-4f0e-93c8-1e92e239c93b.png)

When you're done filling out the information, press the 'Create repository' button to make your new repo.

GitHub will ask if you want to create a new repo from scratch or if you want to add a repo you have created locally. In this case, since we've already created a new repo locally, we want to push that onto GitHub so follow the '....or push an existing repository from the command line' section: 

```shell
git remote add origin https://github.com/developer-metalhead/newrepo.git
git push -u origin master
 ```
 
![step6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133324562-1afc286f-8687-45b0-94a3-903d53d22048.jpg)


### Step 7: Push a branch to GitHub

Now we'll push the commit in your branch to your new GitHub repo. This allows other people to see the changes you've made. If they're approved by the repository's owner, the changes can then be merged into the primary branch.

To push changes onto a new branch on GitHub, you'll want to run `git push origin yourbranchname`. GitHub will automatically create the branch for you on the remote repository:

```shell
git push origin mynewbranch
 ```
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133326310-437163af-c849-48e9-90ad-361b212f97f4.png)

You might be wondering what that "origin" word means in the command above. What happens is that when you clone a remote repository to your local machine, git creates an alias for you. In nearly all cases this alias is called "origin." It's essentially shorthand for the remote repository's URL. So, to push your changes to the remote repository, you could've used either the command: `git push git@github.com:git/git.git yourbranchname` or `git push origin yourbranchname`

![step 7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133326694-b0bf2698-2199-4781-b143-2d6ff425a2ed.png)

Now click the green button in the screenshot above. We're going to make a **pull request!**

### Step 8: Create a pull request (PR)

A pull request (or PR) is a way to alert a repo's owners that you want to make some changes to their code. It allows them to review the code and make sure it looks good before putting your changes on the primary branch.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133327010-2c19d15c-6b16-404e-85cb-6950b5685b4c.png)

This is what it looks like once you've submitted the PR request:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133327099-5cf23214-1c1d-4361-a239-9a36fad0c59d.png)


### Step 9: Merge a PR

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133327310-b4a0e5b0-fe65-4032-9c11-1c9f24540eaa.png)

### Step 10: Get changes on GitHub back to your computer


Right now, the repo on GitHub looks a little different than what you have on your local machine. For example, the commit you made in your branch and merged into the primary branch doesn't exist in the primary branch on your local machine.

In order to get the most recent changes that you or others have merged on GitHub, use the git pull origin master command (when working on the primary branch). In most cases, this can be shortened to`git pull`

```shell
git pull origin master
 ```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133327836-077404e9-44d0-4d6d-83e7-887f33737f2a.png)

his shows you all the files that have changed and how they've changed.

Now we can use the `git log` command again to see all new commits.

```shell

git log
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133328185-97bd8bd0-1049-476b-b4cb-7043267eff1d.png)

### Step 11: Undo a commit

To rollback to a previous commit get the commit id with the command `git log` and then use the `git reset` command.

*Rolling back to the first commit* 

```shell
git reset 393612e2e8fc8dbfd2617ee5c78c3102c80a41c5
git log

```

## Git contribution workflow

This section describes the git workflow that should be used when contributing to open source projects on GitHub. It assumes a very basic understanding of git (commits, branches, etc.) using the command line.

For this document, we will suppose that you want to contribute a patch to
[Four-musketeers/Environment-Friend](https://github.com/Four-Muskeeters/Environment-Friend)

### Cloning and forking the repository

The steps in this section only need to be performed once per repository

1. **Clone the repository.** Click the green `Code` button and copy the url and type <code>git clone <i>clone-url</i></code> at the terminal

```git clone https://github.com/Four-Muskeeters/Environment-Friend```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133375404-a6e3e6eb-58ff-48c8-8752-ce8777b35771.png)

2. **Fork the repo on Github to your personal account** . Click the `fork` button.

![fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133375761-23ef0ec7-43e5-4801-9d53-24122404756a.png)


3. **Add your fork as a remote.** This remote will be named after your github
   username.  Go to the fork of your repository, in this case,
   <code>https://github.com/<i>your-username</i>/Environment</code> (replace *`your-username`* with
   your GitHub username), and copy the clone url as in step 1. `cd` to your
   clone from step 1 and run

   <code>
   git remote add <i>your-github-username</i> <i>fork-url</i>
   </code>
   
  

   (replace *`your-github-username`* with your GitHub username and
   *`fork-url`* with the url that was copied to your clipboard). You will be
   able to tell it is your fork url because it will have your GitHub username
   in it.)
   
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Four-Muskeeters/Environment-Friend
   cd Environment-Friend
   git remote add developer-metalhead https://github.com/developer-metalhead/Environment-Friend-1
   ```
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133377068-77ee1713-d80f-46d5-a5bb-fbd6c8c682b4.png)

## Making changes


1. **Update master.** Before you make any changes, first checkout master

   ```
   git checkout main
   ```

   and pull in the latest changes

   ```
   git pull
   ```

   This will make it so that your changes are against the very latest master,
   which will reduce the likelihood of merge conflicts due to your changes
   conflicting with changes made by someone else.
   
2. **Create a branch.** Once you have done this, create a new branch.

   To create the branch, run

   <code>
   git checkout -b <i>branch-name</i>
   </code>

   (replace *`branch-name`* with the branch name you chose). This will create a
   new branch and check it out. You can verify this with `git status`.
   
   ```git checkout -b fixit```
   
3. **Make your changes and commit them.** Once you have created your branch,
   make your changes and commit them.
   
4. **Push up your changes.**  Push your changes to your fork. Do this by
   running

   <code>
   git push <i>your-github-username</i> <i>branch-name</i>
   </code>

   (replace *`your-github-username`* with your GitHub username and
   *`branch-name`* with the name of the branch)
   
    ```shell 
          git push developer-metalhead fixit
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133378933-39034565-6168-40e6-9041-55bb08c55d6d.png)

5. **Make a pull request.** If you then go to your fork on GitHub, you should
   see a button to create a pull request from your branch. It will look
   something like this. Click compare & pull request button
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133379244-21207e4e-28a0-40d6-a843-05ce5f800d73.png)
   
  Enter a descriptive title in the title field <font color="blue">③</font>.
   This is very important, as it is what will show up in the pull request
   listing and in email notifications to the people in the repo. Pull requests
   with undescriptive titles are more likely to be passed by. If the pull
   request fixes an issue, I recommend putting the issue number in the pull
   request description <font color="blue">④</font>, not the title
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133379414-68fac6b6-64cb-4785-bb37-7eea2dfe39e7.png)
   
### Important points

1. You only need to clone and fork once per repository.

2. Always clone from the main repository and add your fork as a remote.

3. Never commit to master. Create a branch and commit to it.

4. Use `git status` often to check what branch you are on and see if you have
   any uncommitted changes.

5. Be descriptive in your branch names, commit messages, and pull request
   title and descriptions.

6. Once you have a pull request for a branch, you can push additional changes
   to the same branch and they will be added to the pull request
   automatically. You should never create a new pull request for the same
   branch.

7. Comment on the pull request when you want people to know that you have
   pushed new changes. Although GitHub does notify people of commit pushes,
   people are more likely notice your changes if you leave a comment.
   
## Github actions

Github action is a platform to automate developer workflows.

When something happens **IN or TO your repository** --> **automatic ACTIONS** are executed in response
