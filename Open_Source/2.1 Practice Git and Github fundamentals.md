# Practice Git and Github fundamentals

Imagine you are working on a project and you add some code to it that breaks the project and you want to rollback to that point in that before the change was made.
Git facilitates that by acting as a Version control System.

## Issues faced by early developers before git

* Developers had to submit their codes to the `central server` without having copies of their own
* Any changes made to the source code were unknown to the other developers
* There was no communication between any of the developers

## How git changed the scenario

* Every developer has an entire copy of the code on their `local systems`
* Any changes made to the source code can be tracked by others
* There is regular communication between the developers

## What is git?
 
Git is a `version control` system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management in software development:

* Git is used to `track changes` in the source code
* The distributed version control tool is used for source code management
* It allows multiple developers to work together
* It supports non-linear development through its thousands of `parallel branches`

## What is Github

`Github` is a service based upon `git` where people can share their code, contribute to Open Source, etc. 

Imagine you are given a room to do whatever you want to with your accessories , customize our furniture as per you suitability ( each day ) any time. 
Permitted to share the place with some one, bring people to come at your place and party together and you don’t have to pay or rent all this with any bills. 
How cool would that be…!!

Github is a similar space. You have got a free space to put in you code whatever may be your file type - python, java, c, html, js, nodejs…etc. 
You may customize your code any day, any time, any where (having network connection). 
You may allow people / fellow coders to contribute, commit changes to your work. 
Download your project’s code and use it for their work. Follow you and your work and lot more.

## Git vs Github

Git is used to store the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. It allows developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from multiple developers. GitHub facilitates social coding by providing a Web interface to the Git code repository and management tools for collaboration. GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public & private repositories.

## Getting started with git

### Step 0: Install git and create a GitHub account.
### Step 1: Create a local git repository:

When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you'll first create a new repository. To begin, open up a terminal and move to where you want to place the project on your local machine using the cd (change directory) command. For example, if you have a 'projects' folder on your desktop, you'd do something like:

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead>cd Desktop
C:\Users\Metalhead>mkdir myproject
C:\Users\Metalhead>cd myproject
```

To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the git init command: 

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Metalhead/Desktop/myproject/.git/
```

### Step 2: Add a new file to the repo

Go ahead and add a new file to the project, using any text editor you like or running a touch command. `ECHO>> newfile.txt` just creates and saves a blank file named newfile.txt. 

Once you've added or modified files in a folder containing a git repo, git will notice that  the file exists inside the repo. But, git won't track the file unless you explicitly tell it to. Git only saves/manages changes to files that it tracks, so we’ll need to send a command to confirm that yes, we want git to track our new file.

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>ECHO>> newfile.txt
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>dir
newfile.txt
```
After creating the new file, you can use the git status command to see which files git knows exist.

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	newfile.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
What this basically says is, "Hey, we noticed you created a new file called newfile.txt, but unless you use the 'git add' command we aren't going to do anything with it."

### Step 3: Add a file to the staging environment

Add a file to the staging environment using the `git add` command. 

```shell 
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git add newfile.txt
```

If you rerun the git status command, you'll see that git has added the file to the staging environment (notice the "Changes to be committed" line). 

```shell 
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   newfile.txt
```

### Step 4: Create a commit

It's time to create your first commit!

Run the command `git commit -m "Your message about the commit"`

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git commit -m "This is my first commit"
[master (root-commit) 393612e] This is my first commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 newfile.txt
 ```
The message at the end of the commit should be something related to what the commit contains - maybe it's a new feature, maybe it's a bug fix, maybe it's just fixing a typo

### Step 5: Create a new branch

Let's say you are on the primary branch and want to create a new branch to develop your web page. Here's what you'll do: Run `git checkout -b <my branch name>`. This command will automatically create a new branch and then 'check you out' on it, meaning git will move you to that branch, off of the primary branch.
 
 After running the above command, you can use the `git branch` command to confirm that your branch was created:
