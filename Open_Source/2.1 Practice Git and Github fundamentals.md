# Practice Git and Github fundamentals

Imagine you are working on a project and you add some code to it that breaks the project and you want to rollback to that point in that before the change was made.
Git facilitates that by acting as a Version control System.

## Issues faced by early developers before git

* Developers had to submit their codes to the `central server` without having copies of their own
* Any changes made to the source code were unknown to the other developers
* There was no communication between any of the developers

## How git changed the scenario

* Every developer has an entire copy of the code on their `local systems`
* Any changes made to the source code can be tracked by others
* There is regular communication between the developers

## What is git?
 
Git is a `version control` system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management in software development:

* Git is used to `track changes` in the source code
* The distributed version control tool is used for source code management
* It allows multiple developers to work together
* It supports non-linear development through its thousands of `parallel branches`

## What is Github

`Github` is a service based upon `git` where people can share their code, contribute to Open Source, etc. 

Imagine you are given a room to do whatever you want to with your accessories , customize our furniture as per you suitability ( each day ) any time. 
Permitted to share the place with some one, bring people to come at your place and party together and you don’t have to pay or rent all this with any bills. 
How cool would that be…!!

Github is a similar space. You have got a free space to put in you code whatever may be your file type - python, java, c, html, js, nodejs…etc. 
You may customize your code any day, any time, any where (having network connection). 
You may allow people / fellow coders to contribute, commit changes to your work. 
Download your project’s code and use it for their work. Follow you and your work and lot more.

## Git vs Github

Git is used to store the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. It allows developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from multiple developers. GitHub facilitates social coding by providing a Web interface to the Git code repository and management tools for collaboration. GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public & private repositories.

## Getting started with git

### Step 0: Install git and create a GitHub account.
### Step 1: Create a local git repository:

When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you'll first create a new repository. To begin, open up a terminal and move to where you want to place the project on your local machine using the cd (change directory) command. For example, if you have a 'projects' folder on your desktop, you'd do something like:

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead>cd Desktop
C:\Users\Metalhead>mkdir myproject
C:\Users\Metalhead>cd myproject
```

To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the git init command: 

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Metalhead/Desktop/myproject/.git/
```
![step 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133319189-952e5922-4606-46c0-8008-cc712a704855.png)

### Step 2: Add a new file to the repo

Go ahead and add a new file to the project, using any text editor you like or running a touch command. `ECHO>> newfile.txt` just creates and saves a blank file named newfile.txt. 

Once you've added or modified files in a folder containing a git repo, git will notice that  the file exists inside the repo. But, git won't track the file unless you explicitly tell it to. Git only saves/manages changes to files that it tracks, so we’ll need to send a command to confirm that yes, we want git to track our new file.

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>ECHO>> newfile.txt
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>dir
newfile.txt
```
After creating the new file, you can use the git status command to see which files git knows exist.

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	newfile.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
What this basically says is, "Hey, we noticed you created a new file called newfile.txt, but unless you use the 'git add' command we aren't going to do anything with it."

### Step 3: Add a file to the staging environment

Add a file to the staging environment using the `git add` command. 

```shell 
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git add newfile.txt
```

If you rerun the git status command, you'll see that git has added the file to the staging environment (notice the "Changes to be committed" line). 

```shell 
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   newfile.txt
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133321461-9eee8c07-d5be-4cc7-a7df-e1d04084b229.png)

### Step 4: Create a commit

It's time to create your first commit!

Run the command `git commit -m "Your message about the commit"`

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git commit -m "This is my first commit"
[master (root-commit) 393612e] This is my first commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 newfile.txt
 ```
The message at the end of the commit should be something related to what the commit contains - maybe it's a new feature, maybe it's a bug fix, maybe it's just fixing a typo

### Step 5: Create a new branch

Let's say you are on the primary branch and want to create a new branch to develop your web page. Here's what you'll do: Run `git checkout -b <my branch name>`. This command will automatically create a new branch and then 'check you out' on it, meaning git will move you to that branch, off of the primary branch.

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git checkout -b mynewbranch
Switched to a new branch 'mynewbranch'
```
 
 After running the above command, you can use the `git branch` command to confirm that your branch was created:
 
 ```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git branch
  master
* mynewbranch
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133322576-0f3cb49a-77b4-4852-bf2d-dbd35bf53bbb.png)

### Step 6: Create a new repository on GitHub

To create a new repo on GitHub, log in and go to the GitHub home page. You can find the “New repository” option under the “+” sign next to your profile picture, in the top right corner of the navbar:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133322818-08b51544-2912-4782-ba5c-91e9afc9f05a.png)

After clicking the button, GitHub will ask you to name your repo and provide a brief description:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133323264-a8e26a47-6897-4f0e-93c8-1e92e239c93b.png)

When you're done filling out the information, press the 'Create repository' button to make your new repo.

GitHub will ask if you want to create a new repo from scratch or if you want to add a repo you have created locally. In this case, since we've already created a new repo locally, we want to push that onto GitHub so follow the '....or push an existing repository from the command line' section: 

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git remote add origin https://github.com/developer-metalhead/newrepo.git
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git push -u origin master
Enumerating objects: 3, done.
Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 238 bytes | 238.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/developer-metalhead/newrepo.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
 ```
 
![step6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133324562-1afc286f-8687-45b0-94a3-903d53d22048.jpg)


### Step 7: Push a branch to GitHub

Now we'll push the commit in your branch to your new GitHub repo. This allows other people to see the changes you've made. If they're approved by the repository's owner, the changes can then be merged into the primary branch.

To push changes onto a new branch on GitHub, you'll want to run `git push origin yourbranchname`. GitHub will automatically create the branch for you on the remote repository:

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git push origin mynewbranch
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote:
remote: Create a pull request for 'mynewbranch' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/developer-metalhead/newrepo/pull/new/mynewbranch
remote:
To https://github.com/developer-metalhead/newrepo.git
 * [new branch]      mynewbranch -> mynewbranch
 ```
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133326310-437163af-c849-48e9-90ad-361b212f97f4.png)

You might be wondering what that "origin" word means in the command above. What happens is that when you clone a remote repository to your local machine, git creates an alias for you. In nearly all cases this alias is called "origin." It's essentially shorthand for the remote repository's URL. So, to push your changes to the remote repository, you could've used either the command: `git push git@github.com:git/git.git yourbranchname` or `git push origin yourbranchname`

![step 7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133326694-b0bf2698-2199-4781-b143-2d6ff425a2ed.png)

Now click the green button in the screenshot above. We're going to make a **pull request!**

### Step 8: Create a pull request (PR)

A pull request (or PR) is a way to alert a repo's owners that you want to make some changes to their code. It allows them to review the code and make sure it looks good before putting your changes on the primary branch.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133327010-2c19d15c-6b16-404e-85cb-6950b5685b4c.png)

This is what it looks like once you've submitted the PR request:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133327099-5cf23214-1c1d-4361-a239-9a36fad0c59d.png)


### Step 9: Merge a PR

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133327310-b4a0e5b0-fe65-4032-9c11-1c9f24540eaa.png)

### Step 10: Get changes on GitHub back to your computer


Right now, the repo on GitHub looks a little different than what you have on your local machine. For example, the commit you made in your branch and merged into the primary branch doesn't exist in the primary branch on your local machine.

In order to get the most recent changes that you or others have merged on GitHub, use the git pull origin master command (when working on the primary branch). In most cases, this can be shortened to`git pull`

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git pull origin master
remote: Enumerating objects: 6, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), 1.24 KiB | 317.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/developer-metalhead/newrepo
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
   393612e..63dcf00  master     -> origin/master
Updating 393612e..63dcf00
Fast-forward
 newfile.txt | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 ```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85233682/133327836-077404e9-44d0-4d6d-83e7-887f33737f2a.png)

his shows you all the files that have changed and how they've changed.

Now we can use the `git log` command again to see all new commits.

```shell

C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git log
commit 63dcf0063fddebd895ff00637ef21e53ba10dec6 (HEAD -> mynewbranch, origin/master)

### Step 11: Undo a commit

To rollback to a previous commit get the commit id with the command `git log` and then use the `git reset` command.

*Rolling back to the first commit* 

```shell
C:\Users\Metalhead\Desktop\myproject>git reset 393612e2e8fc8dbfd2617ee5c78c3102c80a41c5
Unstaged changes after reset:
M       newfile.txt
