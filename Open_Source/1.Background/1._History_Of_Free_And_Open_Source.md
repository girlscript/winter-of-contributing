# History of free and open-source software (1980 & 1990’s)

In the 1980s software used to be shared via BBS systems and it was
common for source code to be distributed freely, it encouraged hacker
culture which is the basis of free and open source philosophy.But as
researchers were starting software companies, selling licenses for
software became the key to their business models. NDAs and proprietary
software licenses became the norms, Richard Stallman saw this culture
threatened, and advocated that software should not have owners.

Then he decided to create a complete operating system that would not
deprive users of the freedom to understand how it worked, and would
allow them to make changes if they wished. so he launched the GNU
Project in 1983,which spurred the free software movement, and is the
basis for the open source movement. It is thanks to this groundwork that
"open source" and its accompanying principles were established in
1998.The goal of the GNU project was to clone the Unix operating system
to create a system that would give complete freedom to users. <p> </p>

In January 1984 he created the first compiler system the GCC. Then in
Early in 1985, he published "The GNU Manifesto," which was a call to
arms for programmers to join the effort, and launched the Free Software
Foundation in order to accept donations to support the work. This
document is the founding charter of the free software movement.

## The Release of the GNU License

Until 1989, software written and released by the Free Software
Foundation and RMS did not have a single license however, after a
company called Unipress forced Stallman to stop distributing copies of
an Emacs implementation they had acquired from James Gosling,he felt
that a license to secure user freedoms was important. Then first version
of the GNU General Public License was released in 1989, which
encapsulated the values of copyleft(not copyright). You may use, copy,
distribute, and modify the software covered by the license, but if you
make changes, you must share the modified source code alongside the
modified binaries. This simple requirement is what enabled the
decentralized, collaborative development model of the free software
movement to flourish. <p> </p> <p align="center">

## World's First OS <a name="os"></a>

In the early 1990s the free software community received the first
complete free operating system with Linus Torvald’s kernel combined to
GNU operating system. Debian, founded by Ian Murdock in 1993, committed
to the GNU and FSF principles of free software. Linux adoption by
businesses and governments began in the late 1990s. Website-based
companies emerged and made extensive use of free web servers, especially
the Apache HTTP Server. The LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack
gained popularity over expensive proprietary solutions. <p> </p>

## Cathedral Bazaar <a name="cb"></a>

In 1997, Eric S. Raymond published the seminal essay, "The Cathedral and
the Bazaar," comparing and contrasting the development methodologies and
social structure of GCC and the Linux kernel and talking about his own
experiences with a "bazaar" development model with the Fetchmail
project. Many of the principles that Raymond describes in this essay
will later become central to agile development and the DevOps
movement—"release early, release often," refactoring of code, and
treating users as co-developers are all fundamental to modern software
development.

</p>

<p> </p> This essay has been credited with bringing free software to a
broader audience, and with convincing executives at software companies
at the time that releasing their software under a free software license
was the right thing to do. Raymond went on to be instrumental in the
coining of the term "open source" and the creation of the Open Source
Institute.

"The Cathedral and the Bazaar" was credited as a key document in the
1998 release of the source code for the Netscape web browser Mozilla. At
the time, this was the first major release of an existing, widely used
piece of desktop software as free software, which brought it further
into the public eye.

## “Open source” is born <a name="osib"></a>

Up until this point, free software was not widely adopted commercially.
Plagued by politics and associated with the GPL which many considered
far too liberal, the movement was unpopular with corporations, who often
viewed free software as a threat to their own products.

Ahead of the release of Netscape Communicator’s source code, a strategy
session was held in Palo Alto with some of the major influencers of the
free software movement, including Linus Torvalds, Tim O’Reilly, James
Zawinski, and others. To capitalize on the attention and momentum from
the Navigator news, they rebranded <b>“free software” as “open source,”
</b> to distance from the political associations of the free software
movement, and bring the principles of free software to the commercial
software industry. <p> </p> <p align="center"  >

</p> <p> </p>

Richard Stallman rejected the term, preferring “free software” and its
associated message of social values and users’ freedom, resulting in
division among the free and open source community over which terminology
they identify with. Free and open source software (FOSS) encompasses
both terms.

In February 1998 , to evangelize open source Raymond founded the Open
Source Initiative, citing “higher quality, better reliability, greater
flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory vendor lock-in” as some
of the primary reasons to advocate for open source. <p> </p>

## Commercialisation of open source <a name="c"></a>

Commercial companies did not welcome open source at first. In the late
1990s, a series of high-profile events led to a huge increase in the
professionalization of free and open source software. Among these, the
highest-profile events were the IPOs of VA Linux and Red Hat in 1999.
Both companies had massive gains in share price on their opening days as
publicly traded companies, proving that open source was now going
commercial and mainstream. <p> </p>
