# Rise Of Open Source Programming Languages

Open-source programming languages have been one of the most underrated elements that have helped propel technology. Most of the time, the credit is given to devices and apps, but it is programming languages that allow developers to build great source code and the amazing digital products we as users love.

## What Are Open-Source Programming Languages

Open-source programming languages are not owned by anyone. They are easily available, they are usually maintained by a community, and on many occasions, they are also freely distributed under different open-source licenses.

**Some of the worldâ€™s most popular programming languages are open source.** The reason for this is that, when computers started gaining popularity in the second half of the past century, many developers saw the benefits of developing open-source projects around programming languages. This has remained up to this day. Some of the early languages, like C, started as open-source projects, and they are still used in many software projects, including apps.

- ### _Open-source Communities_

  Most open-source projects are maintained by a community of developers, and open-source programming languages are no exception. It helps to solve technical issues in a fast and reliable way. When a developer encounters a problem, We can easily look for solutions on the Internet as someone in the community might had the same issue and solved it.

- ### _Open-source Libraries_
  Aside from creating a vast open-source project database of knowledge that is easily accessible, some developers also build code libraries that can be **reused** by other developers. 

Take, for example, the case of Ruby on Rails, an open-source web development framework that uses the Ruby programming language. It is one of the most popular programming languages to build web applications, and because of its many libraries and resources for developers .
