Repositories on Github are often used to share open source software. But for a repository to be truly open source you need to license it to allow other people to use that code. A repository that does not contain a license cannot be used by anyone else for their own projects.

## Why licensing is important for your project?
- When you make a creative work such as writings, graphics, code, that work is under exclusive copyright by default.That is, the law assumes that as the author of your work, you have a say in what others can do with it.
- This means that nobody  else can use copy or distribute or modify your work without being at the risk of facing legal consequences.
- If you don't apply an open source license, everybody who contributes to your project becomes an exclusive copyright holder of the work and nobody can modify their contributions( including you).
- Therefore, since the by default you have exclusive rights over your project, you need to include licenses to allow other people to use your project.

## Which Github License should I use?
There are three basic licenses that will serve the needs of most users. These are:
- If you want your project to be used as a dependency by other projects: [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) is for you.
- If you want your project to appeal to leage businesses, the [Apache 2.0 License ](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) is for you.
- If you want your project to appeal to contributors who don't want their contributions to be used in a closed source software: [GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) and [AGPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/) are licenses are for you.

If these licenses still do not suffice you, you can take a look at [these licenses](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/).
If your project is not a software then you can take look at [these licenses](https://choosealicense.com/non-software/)

## What happens if I don't include a license?
If you publish your code on Github you have accepted the [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service) by which you allow others to view and fork your repository. Others may not need your permission [limitations and exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitations_and_exceptions_to_copyright) apply to their particular situation such as experimentatio, modification and sharing.

If you find a software that you want to use but does not contain a license, you can:
- Add the maintainers nicely to add  a license.
- Negotitate a private license.

If both of these do not work then you are not allowed to use the software under any conditions.

If your goal is completely opt-out of copyright restrictions you can try a [public domain dedication](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/#unlicense)
