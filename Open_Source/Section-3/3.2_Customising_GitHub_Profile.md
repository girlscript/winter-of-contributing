## About your profile

**Your profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you're interested in, the contributions you've made, and the conversations you've had.**

You can add personal information about yourself in your bio, like previous places you've worked, projects you've contributed to, or interests you have that other people may like to know about. For more information, see ["Adding a bio to your profile."](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#adding-a-bio-to-your-profile)


If you add a README file to the root of a public repository with the same name as your username, that README will automatically appear on your profile page. You can edit your profile README with GitHub Flavored Markdown to create a personalized section on your profile. For more information, see ["Managing your profile README."](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)

People who visit your profile see a timeline of your contribution activity, like issues and pull requests you've opened, commits you've made, and pull requests you've reviewed. You can choose to display only public contributions or to also include private, anonymized contributions.

People who visit your profile can also see the following information.

- Repositories and gists you own or contribute to. You can showcase your best work by pinning repositories and gists to your profile.Pine items to your profile.
- Repositories you've starred.
- An overview of your activity in organizations, repositories, and teams you're most active in. Show an overview of your activity on your profile.
- Badges that show if you use GitHub Pro or participate in programs like the Arctic Code Vault, GitHub Sponsors, or the GitHub Developer Program. For more information, see ["Personalizing your profile."]()

You can also set a status on your profile to provide information about your availability

# Personalizing your profile

You can share information about yourself with other GitHub users by setting a profile picture and adding a bio to your profile.

- Changing your profile picture

Your profile picture helps identify you across GitHub in pull requests, comments, contributions pages, and graphs.

When you sign up for an account, GitHub provides you with a randomly generated "identicon". Your identicon generates from a hash of your user ID, so there's no way to control its color or pattern. You can replace your identicon with an image that represents you.

*Tip: Your profile picture should be a PNG, JPG, or GIF file under 1 MB in size. For the best quality rendering, we recommend keeping the image at about 500 by 500 pixels.*

## Setting a profile picture
 
In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.

- when people hover over your username or avatar on GitHub.
- on a team page for a team where you're a team member. 
- on the organization dashboard in an organization where you're a member.

# Pinning items to your profile

- You can pin gists and repositories to your profile so other people can quickly see your best work.

- You can pin a public repository if you own the repository or you've made contributions to the repository. Commits to forks don't count as contributions, so you can't pin a fork that you don't own. For more information, see "Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile?"

- You can pin any public gist you own.

*Pinned items include important information about the item, like the number of stars a repository has received or the first few lines of a gist. Once you pin items to your profile, the "Pinned" section replaces the "Popular repositories" section on your profile.*

You can reorder the items in the "Pinned" section. In the upper-right corner of a pin, click  and drag the pin to a new location.

1.In the top right corner of GitHub, click your profile photo, then click Your profile<br/>

# Managing your profile README

You can add a README to your GitHub profile to tell other people about yourself.

## About your profile README

You can share information about yourself with the community on GitHub by creating a profile README. GitHub shows your profile README at the top of your profile page.

You decide what information to include in your profile README, so you have full control over how you present yourself on GitHub. Here are some examples of information that visitors may find interesting, fun, or useful in your profile README.

- An "About me" section that describes your work and interests
- Contributions you're proud of, and context about those contributions
- Guidance for getting help in communities where you're involved

You can format text and include emoji, images, and GIFs in your profile README by using GitHub Flavored Markdown
