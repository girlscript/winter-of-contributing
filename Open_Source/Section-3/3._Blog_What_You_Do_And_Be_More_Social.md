# **HOW TO INTRODUCE YOUR PROJECT**
**1.BREIF DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE PROJECT**

The description is the first thing everyone sees before deep diving in documentation.Therefore a good description should answer in a short and informative manner the *what* question.

**2.MAIN DOCUMENTATION**

The documentation should contain a detailed description (which expands on the *what* question) and very detailed instructions on how to use you project.
The instructions should cover every single piece of public API, preferably with usage examples.

**POINTS TO KEEP IN MIND**

1.Keep it simple – The simpler the API and the example, the easier for a user to understand what it does on how to use it

2.Keep it structured – Use the same template and visual structure for every API method. This way you’ll define your own language for communicating the API to the user.

3.Be a user – Always write API description from the user's perspective. Assume that you know nothing about the internals and this documentation is all you have.

4.Keep it up to date – As your project evolves, the APIs might change. Make sure that your README file always contains the most current APIs and examples.
