# Notepad++

Notepad++ is a free programme that you may download and use, it's a lightweight application so it doesn't take a lot of computer resources it's very similar to Microsoft notepad if you've used that or any other text editor but it adds a lot more features for computer programmers. The project was formerly hosted on SourceForge.net, where it has had over 28 million downloads and has won the SourceForge Community Choice Award for Best Developer Tool.

## Features in Notepad++ 

Notepad++ includes tools for reading and writing plain text files that are cross-platform. It can convert between three different newline representations (CR, CR+LF, and LF) on the fly. It can also rewrite plain text files in a variety of character encodings and convert them to ASCII, UTF-8, or UCS-2. As a result, it may correct plain text that appears nonsensical due to improper character encoding detection.  

It also has features that improve plain text editing experience in general, such as:
- Autosave
- Finding and replacing strings of text with regular expressions
- Searching text strings within opened tabs
- Split screen editing and synchronized scrolling
- Simultaneous editing
- Line operations, including sorting, case conversion, and removal of redundant whitespace
- Line bookmarking
- Guided indentation

## Notepad++ – Pros   

- **Open Source and Free**: Like other code editors on our list, Notepad++ is an open source project. Users can contribute in many different ways.  
- **Solid Standard Features**: Notepad++ is jampacked with standard features, It supports more than 50 programming, scripting and markup languages and including syntax highlighting and code folding. 
- **Fully Customizable User Interface**: It's interface is adjustable in many different ways. For one, you can control whether tabs align vertically, horizontally and/or behind one another.  
- **Document Map and Multiple Cursors**:  it includes a number of features that other code editors strongly advertise but completely fly under the radar in this one.  
- **Macros**: The ability to work with macros is another fantastic feature of Notepad++. Macros, for the uninitiated, are records of complex procedures that can be automatically repeated so you don't have to.  


## Notepad++ – Cons   

- **Plugin Management Could Be Better**: This code editor's handling of plugins is another flaw, not least since the plugin management doesn't (yet) operate with the 64-bit version.  
- **Old-School Design**: The editor's design is one of its major turnoffs. Notepad++ appears to be trapped in Windows 95 in a time when even Microsoft managed to design a good user interface for their operating system.  


## Conclusion  
Notepad++ is a pleasant surprise among the many available code editors. Underneath its unassuming façade is a robust, configurable code editor with a plethora of functionality that supports a wide range of programming languages.  
The programme can even be expanded to pretty much anything you need and delivers notable features of other code editors without making a big deal about it. All of this comes at no cost, therefore it's a fantastic piece of open source software.
