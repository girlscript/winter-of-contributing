Appwrite is an end-to-end backend server that aims to abstract the complexities of common, complicated, and repetitive processes involved in developing modern apps.

Appwrite provides a set of APIs, tools, and a management panel UI to assist you in building apps much faster and more securely. User authentication and account administration, 
user preferences, database and storage persistence, cloud functions, localization, image manipulation, scheduled background tasks, and more are all available through Appwrite's 
various services.

Appwrite is technology agnostic and cross-platform, meaning it can run on any operating system, programming language, framework, or platform. Although Appwrite fits the definition
of a serverless technology, it's built to work in a variety of environments. Appwrite can be integrated directly into your client app, used behind your custom backend, or used in
conjunction with your custom backend server.

## Installation

The Appwrite backend server is built to work in a container environment. It's as simple as typing one command into your console to start your server. You can use docker-compose to
execute Appwrite locally, or any other container orchestration technology such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or Rancher.

Our docker-compose file is the simplest method to get your Appwrite server up and running.
Make sure Docker is installed on your machine before performing the installation command:

### UNIX
```
docker run -it --rm \
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --volume "$(pwd)"/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw \
    --entrypoint="install" \
    appwrite/appwrite:0.10.4
```
### Windows

**CMD**

```
docker run -it --rm ^
    --volume //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
    --volume "%cd%"/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw ^
    --entrypoint="install" ^
    appwrite/appwrite:0.10.4

```

**Powershell**

```
docker run -it --rm ,
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ,
    --volume ${pwd}/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw ,
    --entrypoint="install" ,
    appwrite/appwrite:0.10.4

```

Once the Docker installation completes, go to http://localhost to access the Appwrite console from your browser. Please note that on non-linux native hosts,
the server might take a few minutes to start after installation completes.
