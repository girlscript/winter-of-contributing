# <center><b>What is CodeIgniter?</b></center>
CodeIgniter is an open-source web framework for PHP. It provides lots of libraries and packages, so you won’t have to build web applications and web pages from scratch.

It simplifies the PHP code and brings out a fully interactive, dynamic website at a much shorter time. It supports PHP version of 5.2.6 or newer and MySQL version 4.1 or newer. It makes your web more robust and your code easier to read and maintain. It is a free toolkit, light weight and easier to install.



## Developers :-

Initial release :- 	February 28, 2006.

# How CodeIgniter works
CodeIgniter works on MVC (Model View Controller) Pattern. As the user requests for any resources from the CodeIgniter website, firstly index.php handle that request. As index.php acts as the frontend controller and initializes the base resources to run the framework.

Then comes the routing part. If any routes are overwritten then are considered at this point.
After this point the framework checks for the caching. If present the user is provided the cached response, without executing internal code and database queries. This feature enables for faster response.

If caching is not enabled then user data and HTTP requests are filtered by Codeigniter to filter for security purpose.

Then reaches the controller and required models, helpers, libraries and other plugins and scripts are executed to get the result.

This result is then finalized in the form of view which is the display part. That view is sent to the user as a response. In between (if caching is enabled) the view is stored in cached for handling to provide faster response similar request again without internal system execution.
