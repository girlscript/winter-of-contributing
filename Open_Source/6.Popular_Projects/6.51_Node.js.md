## Introduction

Node.js is a cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser that is open-source. It's important to note that NodeJS is neither a framework 
nor a programming language. The majority of folks are perplexed and believe it is a framework or programming language. We frequently utilise Node.js to create back-end services 
such as APIs, Web Apps, and Mobile Apps. Large corporations like Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, and others use it in their production.

## History of NodeJS

JavaScript is a scripting language developed by Netscape as a way to manipulate online pages within their browser, Netscape Navigator.

Netscape's business model included selling Web Servers, which featured a programme called Netscape LiveWire that allowed users to construct dynamic pages using server-side
JavaScript. Unfortunately, Netscape LiveWire was a flop, and server-side JavaScript didn't gain traction until lately, thanks to Node.js.

One key factor that led to the rise of Node.js was the timing. Just a few years earlier, JavaScript had started to be considered as a more serious language, thanks to 
"Web 2.0" applications (such as Flickr, Gmail, etc.) that showed the world what a modern experience on the web could be like.

As numerous browsers raced to offer users the best performance, JavaScript engines improved significantly. Major browser development teams worked hard to improve JavaScript 
support and identify ways to make JavaScript run quicker. The Node.js engine, V8 (also known as Chrome V8 because it is The Chromium Project's open-source JavaScript engine),
improved greatly as a result of the competition.

Node.js was built in the right place at the right time, but it isn't the sole reason for its current popularity. It presents several new ideas and methodologies for JavaScript 
server-side development that have already proven useful to many developers.

## Features of NodeJS

Other programming languages can also be used to create back-end services, so what sets Node.js apart?

- It's simple to use and may be used for prototyping as well as agile development.
- It offers services that are both quick and scalable.
- Because it uses JavaScript everywhere, it's simple for a JavaScript programmer to use Node.js to create back-end services.
- Cleaner and more consistent source code.
- Open source library has a large ecosystem.
- Its nature is asynchronous or non-blocking.

## Advantages of NodeJS

- **Easy Scalability:** Node.js is preferred by developers because it allows for easy horizontal and vertical scaling of applications. During the application's scalability,
we may also add more resources.
- **Real-time web apps:** If you're making a web app, you may use PHP instead of Node.js, and it will take the same amount of time. However, if you're doing a chat app or a
gaming app, Node.js is far superior due to faster synchronisation. For Node.js programming, the event loop also prevents HTTP overload.
- **Fast Suite:** NodeJs runs on the V8 engine developed by Google. Event loop in NodeJs handles all asynchronous operation so NodeJs acts like a fast suite and all the 
operations can be done quickly like reading or writing in the database, network connection, or file system.
- **Easy to learn and code:** Because it uses JavaScript, NodeJs is simple to learn and code. You can quickly learn and build the application using NodeJS if you are a 
front-end developer with a decent understanding of JavaScript.
- **Advantage of Caching:** It allows you to cache a single module. The first module is cached in the application memory whenever it is requested, so you don't have to 
re-execute the code.
- **Data Streaming:** The HTTP request and response are treated separately in NodeJs. They are data streams, therefore processing a file at the time of loading will lower 
the overall time and make the data presentation in the form of transmissions faster. You may also stream audio and video files at breakneck speeds.
- **Hosting:** PaaS (Platform as a Service) and Heroku are two hosting platforms for NodeJS app deployment that are simple to use and trouble-free.
- **Corporate Support:** The majority of well-known organisations, such as Walmart, Paypal, Microsoft, and Yahoo, use NodeJS to construct their apps. Because NodeJS uses 
JavaScript, most businesses have merged their front-end and back-end teams into a single entity.

## Application of NodeJS

- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Real-Time Chat Apps
- Single-Page Applications (SPAs) 
- Real-Time Collaboration Tools
- Streaming Apps
- JSON APIs based application
- Apps with microservices architecture
