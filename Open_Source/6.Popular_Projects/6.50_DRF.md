## Overview

Django Rest Framework lets you create RESTful APIs: A way to transfer information between an interface and a database in a simple way.
It separates user interface and data storage and communicates user and database sending a .json file.

The Django REST framework (DRF) is a toolkit built on top of the Django web framework that reduces the amount of code you need to write to create REST interfaces. It is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

### Reasons to use REST framework :
- The `Web browsable API` is a huge usability win for your developers.
- `Authentication` policies including packages for _OAuth1a_ and _OAuth2_.
- `Serialization` that supports both _ORM_ and _non-ORM_ data sources.
- Customizable all the way down - just use `regular function-based views` if you don't need the more powerful features.
- Extensive documentation, and `great community support`.
- Used and trusted by internationally recognised companies including _Mozilla_, _Red Hat_, _Heroku_, and _Eventbrite_.

## Requirements

REST framework requires the following:

- Python (3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9)
- Django (2.2, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2)

The following packages are optional:

- __PyYAML, uritemplate__ (5.1+, 3.0.0+) - Schema generation support.
- __Markdown__ (3.0.0+) - Markdown support for the browsable API.
- __Pygments__ (2.4.0+) - Add syntax highlighting to Markdown processing.
- __django-filter__ (1.0.1+) - Filtering support.
- __django-guardian__ (1.1.1+) - Object level permissions support.

<br/>

## Installation

Install using `pip`, including any optional packages you want.
 
    pip install djangorestframework
    pip install markdown       # Markdown support for the browsable API.
    pip install django-filter  # Filtering support

or clone the project from github.

    git clone https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework

Add 'rest_framework' to your INSTALLED_APPS setting.

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'rest_framework',
    ]

To use the browsable API you'll probably also want to add REST framework's login and logout views. Add the following to your root urls.py file.

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path('api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls'))
    ]

_Note that the URL path can be whatever you want._

<br/>

## _Example of using REST framework to build a simple model-backed API_

Create a read-write API for accessing information on the users of our project.

Any global settings for a REST framework API are kept in a single configuration dictionary named __`REST_FRAMEWORK`__. Start off by adding the following to your `settings.py` module:

```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    # Use Django's standard `django.contrib.auth` permissions,
    # or allow read-only access for unauthenticated users.
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly'
    ]
}
```

_Don't forget to make sure you've also added `rest_framework` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`._

We're ready to create our API now. Here's our project's root `urls.py` module:

```python
    from django.urls import path, include
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from rest_framework import routers, serializers, viewsets

    # Serializers define the API representation.
    class UserSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
        class Meta:
            model = User
            fields = ['url', 'username', 'email', 'is_staff']

    # ViewSets define the view behavior.
    class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
        queryset = User.objects.all()
        serializer_class = UserSerializer

    # Routers provide an easy way of automatically determining the URL conf.
    router = routers.DefaultRouter()
    router.register(r'users', UserViewSet)

    # Wire up our API using automatic URL routing.
    # Additionally, we include login URLs for the browsable API.
    urlpatterns = [
        path('', include(router.urls)),
        path('api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework'))
    ]
```

You can now open the API in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/, and view your new 'users' API.<br/>
If you use the login control in the top right corner you'll also be able to add, create and delete users from the system.
