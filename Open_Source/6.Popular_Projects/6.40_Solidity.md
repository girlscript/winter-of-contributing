 Solidity is an `object-oriented programming language` designed for developing smart contracts that run on `Ethereum`. It is highly influenced by C++, JavaScript and Python and  used for implementing small contracts on various `blockchain` platforms such as `Ethereum`. It has been made to target the `Ethereum Virtual Machine`. It is a statically-   typed curly braces programming language which supports inheritance, libraries and also complex user-defined types among other features.   
 You can create contracts for uses such as crowdfunding, voting and multi-signature wallets with the help of Solidity.   
    
      
## Methods to setup Solidity compiler on CentOS machine :
---

### Method 1 - npm / Node.js  
>  Install Node.js by using the following commands -
 ```
# First install epel-release
$sudo yum install epel-release

# Now install nodejs
$sudo yum install nodejs

# Next install npm (Nodejs Package Manager )
$sudo yum install npm

# Finally verify installation
$npm --version
```
> After installation, you will get an output something like this -

```
3.10.10
```
> Install solc(Solidity compiler)
 
```
$sudonpm install -g solc
```
> The above command will install `solcjs` program. Now you can test your solidity by issuing following command -
```
$solcjs-version
```

> If everything goes fine, then this will print something as follows -
```
0.5.2+commit.1df8f40c.Emscripten.clang
```

### Method 2 - Docker Image
> Following is the command to pull a Solidity Docker Image and start using it to start with Solidity programming -
```
$docker pull ethereum/solc:stable
```
> You can verify whether a docker image is downloaded or not by using the following command -
```
$docker run ethereum/solc:stable-version
```
> This will print something as follows -
```
$ docker run ethereum/solc:stable -version

solc, the solidity compiler commandlineinterfaceVersion: 0.5.2+commit.1df8f40c.Linux.g++
```
## Solidity - Basic Syntax :
---
 A Solidity source files can contain an any number of _import directives_, _pragma directives_ and _contract definitions_.  
 Following is an example of a simple source file of Solidity - 
 ```
 pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.6.0;
contract SimpleStorage {
   uint storedData;
   function set(uint x) public {
      storedData = x;
   }
   function get() public view returns (uint) {
      return storedData;
   }
}
```
## Importing Files :
---
Solidity supports import statements similar to those available in JavaScript.  
> The following statement imports all global symbols from `"filename"`.  
```
import "filename";
```
> The following example makes a new global symbol symbolName whose members are all the global symbols from `"filename"`.
```
import * as symbolName from "filename";
```
Use import "./x" as x; to import a file from the same directory as the current file.

## Reserved Keywords :
Following are the reserved keywords in Solidity -  

* abstract                  
* auto
* default
* implements
* macro
* of
* reference
* static
* typedef 
* after
* case
* define
* match
* override
