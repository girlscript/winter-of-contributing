```

### About Django Admin Panel

Django provides built-in admin module to monitor all the CRUD Operations on the django tables(models).It provides a user-friendly interface where user can manage the content and data of the application.

The admin app *(django.contrib.admin)* is enabled by default and already added into INSTALLED_APPS section of the settings file of the project.

#### Ways to access admin panel

##### 1. After checking all the configurations in the setting file, again run the server.
#
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

##### 2. Apply migrations
By default , some changes are not migrated in the django project , hence to perform those changes , use the following commands.

```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

##### 3. Use the */admin/* extension after your localhost url to access the panel page

###  Create Django App
Django application comprises various projects and app. It also generates an automatic base directory.


#### 1. Steps to create django app
#
```sh
python manage.py startapp appname
```
#### 2. Register the app in your settings file
All the configurations are stored in settings.py file of the main project hence it is mandatory to register the app under the *INSTALLED_APP* settings of the project.

```sh
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'appname',
]
```

### File Structure and its uses
Django has a hierarichal file structure which is easy to understand and work with . Its the file structure that makes django flexible to learn for beginners.

#### 1. Settings file
*Settings.py*  is the first file which is run when a project runs. This file contains the all the configurations starting from server and host setting to database and template settings.If you work with external apis or you want to integrate ml model in your project then , its settings.py file that comes into play first.

##### Fields in settings file
1. Database settings
2. Template settings
3. Host settings
4. login configurations
5. static file settings
6. Admin settings
7.  Api and other stuff

#### 2. Models File
Django works on *MVT(Model View Template)* software design pattern hence we tend to list all the tables required in the project . Model files contains table names and essential field for that respective table.

Django Model is a subclass of *django.db.models.Model* and each field of the model class represents a database field (column).

Django provides us a database-abstraction API which allows us to create, retrieve, update and delete a record from the mapped table.

Here is an example of the model

```sh
class user(models.Model):
name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
age = models.IntegerField(max_length=100)
```

Some of the fields which we can use while creating models.
1. AutoField
2. BigAutoField
3. BigIntegerField
4. BinaryField
5. BooleanField
6. ImageField
7. CharField
8. IntegerField
9. EmailField
10. DateTimeField


#### 3. Django Views

Django view comprise views.py file where we can put all our business logic . This business logic tends work out various functionalities and logics of the application and return response to the user

#### 4. Urls
Views comes with urls. We need to route a view so as to see its response hence it is important to route a url in urls.py file of the project

```sh
path('index/',index,name=index)
```

#### 5. Templates

Python being a dynamic backend framework needs hypertext markup language to render the data and present it for the user's to see.Django template engine is used to separate the design from the python code and allows us to build dynamic web pages.

For templates to function, we need to add it in *INSTALLED_APPS* section of the settings file

```sh
    TEMPLATES = [  
        {  
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',  
            'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')],  
            'APP_DIRS': True,  
            'OPTIONS': {  
                'context_processors': [  
                    'django.template.context_processors.debug',  
                    'django.template.context_processors.request',  
                    'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',  
                    'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',  
                ],  
            },  
        },  
    ]  
```

And , here we are , starting and working with top rated and flexible backend framework.Everything technology needs to researched carefully hence if you want to learn more about this amazing frameworks , just head towards its documentation.

Thank You!
