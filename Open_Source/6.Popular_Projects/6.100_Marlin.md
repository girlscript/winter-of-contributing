# MARLIN


## Marlin is open source firmware primarily designed for RepRap project based FDM (fused deposition modelling) 3D-printers using the Arduino platform.

#### The firmware runs G-code formatted coded commands and instruction sets as robot software on the 3D printer's control board which manages all of the machine's
#### real-time activities including sending movement coordinates to stepper motors through the stepper drivers, controlling heater elements, sensors, lights, tracking
#### bed levelling, LC displays and buttons.[4] Marlin supports many different boards and many designs of 3D printer robot platforms, 
#### including Cartesian (including Core XY), Delta and SCARA printers, as well as some other less conventional designs like Hangprinter.

## Marlin 

was first created in 2011 for the RepRap and Ultimaker printers; it is used today by many, if not most, relatively inexpensive 3D-printers for plastic-based 
Fused filament fabrication (also known as fused deposition modelling) and claims to be the most widely used 3D printing firmware in the world.[2] With perhaps the most 
famous or infamous products/brands using the Marlin firmware (or forks of the Marlin firmware) being;
Ultimaker, LulzBot by Aleph Objects, Original Prusa i3 by Prusa Research, plus the various Ender and CR series by Creality.

## Is RepRap the same as Marlin?

Marlin is firmware for RepRap single-processor electronics, supporting RAMPS, RAMBo, Ultimaker, BQ, and several other Arduino-based 3D printers. 
It supports printing over USB or from SD cards with folders, and uses lookahead trajectory planning. Marlin is licensed under the GNU GPL v3 or later.

## What is RepRap firmware?

RepRapFirmware is a comprehensive motion control firmware intended primarily for controlling 3D printers, but with applications in laser engraving/cutting and CNC too.
Unlike most other 3D printer firmwares, it is targeted only at modern 32-bit processors, not outdated 8-bit processors with limited CPU power.
