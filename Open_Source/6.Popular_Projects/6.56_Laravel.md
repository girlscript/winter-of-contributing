# [LARAVEL](https://laravel.com/)

Laravel is an open-source web MVC framework for PHP. Laravel is a robust framework that provides easy development of PHP web applications with features like a modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency manager, access to relational databases, and other utilities for application deployment and maintenance.

Laravel was created by Taylor Otwell. Since its initial release in June 2011 (version 1), it has steadily grown more and more popular in the PHP-framework sector of the web development industry. A lot of this popularity can be attributed to the many developer-first-minded features that it comes with stock.

## Advantages of Laravel

Following are some advantages of Laravel:

</p>

* **Creating authorization and authentication systems:-** Every owner of the web application makes sure that unauthorized users do not access secured or paid resources. It provides a simple way of implementing authentication. It also provides a simple way of organizing the authorization logic and control access to resources.

* **Integration with tools:-** Laravel is integrated with many tools that build a faster app. It is not only necessary to build the app but also to create a faster app. Integration with the caching back end is one of the major steps to improve the performance of a web app. Laravel is integrated with some popular cache back ends such as Redis, and Memcached.

* **Mail service integration:-** Laravel is integrated with the Mail Service. This service is used to send notifications to the user's emails. It provides a clean and simple API that allows you to send the email quickly through a local or cloud-based service of your choice.

* **Handling exception and configuration error:-** Handling exception and configuration errors are the major factors on the app's usability. The manners in which the software app handles the errors have a huge impact on the user's satisfaction and the app's usability. The organization does not want to lose their customers, so for them, Laravel is the best choice. In Laravel, error and exception handling is configured in the new Laravel project.

* **Automation testing work:-** Testing a product is very important to make sure that the software runs without any errors, bugs, and crashes. We know that automation testing is less time-consuming than manual testing, so automation testing is preferred over the manual testing. Laravel is developed with testing in mind.

* **Separation of business logic code from presentation code:-** The separation between business logic code and presentation code allows the HTML layout designers to change the look without interacting with the developers. A bug can be resolved by the developers faster if the separation is provided between the business logic code and presentation code. We know that Laravel follows the MVC architecture, so separation is already done.

* **Fixing most common technical vulnerabilities:-** The security vulnerability is the most important example in web application development. An American organization, i.e., OWASP Foundation, defines the most important security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site request forgery, cross-site scripting, etc. Developers need to consider these vulnerabilities and fix them before delivery. Laravel is a secure framework as it protects the web application against all the security vulnerabilities.

* **Scheduling tasks configuration and management:-** The web app requires some task scheduling mechanism to perform the tasks in time for example, when to send out the emails to the subscribers or when to clean up the database tables at the end of the day. To schedule the tasks, developers need first to create the Cron entry for each task, but Laravel command scheduler defines a command schedule which requires a single entry on the server.

## Features of Laravel

We know that PHP is the oldest programming language used by the programmers, and more than 20 million websites are developed by using PHP. PHP is a very suitable programming language as it satisfies the business requirements whether the business is big or small. Laravel is one of the most popular frameworks having a high rich set of functionalities.

Laravel is provided with a well-defined toolbox that allows the developers to write less code leading to less possibility of errors.

Following are the features of Laravel:

</p>

* **Authentication:-** Authentication is the most important factor in a web application, and developers need to spend a lot of time writing the authentication code. Laravel makes a simpler authentication when Laravel is updated to Laravel 5. Laravel contains an inbuilt authentication system, you only need to configure models, views, and controllers to make the application work.

* **Innovative Template Engine:-** Laravel provides an innovative template engine which allows the developers to create the dynamic website. The available widgets in Laravel can be used to create solid structures for an application.

* **Effective ORM:-** Laravel contains an inbuilt ORM with easy PHP Active Record implementation. An effective ORM allows the developers to query the database tables by using the simple PHP syntax without writing any SQL code. It provides easy integration between the developers and database tables by giving each of the tables with their corresponding models.

* **MVC Architecture Support:-** Laravel supports MVC architecture. It provides faster development process as in MVC; one programmer can work on the view while other is working on the controller to create the business logic for the web application. It provides multiple views for a model, and code duplication is also avoided as it separates the business logic from the presentation logic.

* **Secure Migration System:-** Laravel framework can expand the database without allowing the developers to put much effort every time to make changes, and the migration process of Laravel is very secure and full-proof. In the whole process, php code is used rather than SQL code.

* **Unique Unit-testing:-** aravel provides a unique unit-testing. Laravel framework can run several test cases to check whether the changes harm the web app or not. In Laravel, developers can also write the test cases in their own code.

* **Artisan:-** Laravel framework provides a built-in tool for a command-line known as Artisan that performs the repetitive programming tasks that do not allow the php developers to perform manually. These artisans can also be used to create the skeleton code, database structure, and their migration, so it makes it easy to manage the database of the system. It also generates the MVC files through the command line. Artisan also allows the developers to create their own commands.
