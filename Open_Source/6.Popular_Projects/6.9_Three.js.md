<h1 align="center"> About three.js </h1> 

Three.js is a JavaScript toolkit and application programming interface (API) that uses WebGL to produce and display dynamic 3D computer graphics in a web browser. 
The source code is available on a GitHub repository.

Three.js uses the JavaScript language to create GPU-accelerated 3D animations that can be included in a website without the need for proprietary browser plugins.
Because to the introduction of WebGL, this is now possible.

Complex 3D computer animations can be created in the browser using high-level frameworks like Three.js or GLGE, SceneJS, PhiloGL, or a variety of other tools without the effort 
required for a traditional standalone application or plugin.

## Features of Three.js

- Effects: Anaglyph, cross-eyed, and parallax barrier.
- Scenes: items can be added and removed at any time during playback; fog
- Cameras: perspective and orthographic; controllers: trackball, FPS, and path
- Shaders: complete OpenGL Shading Language support (GLSL) lens flare, depth pass, and a large post-processing library are among the features available.
- Animation: armatures, forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, morph, and keyframe
- Lights: ambient, direction, point, and spot lights; shadows: cast and receive
- Materials: Lambert, Phong, smooth shading, textures, and more
- Data loaders: binary, image, JSON, and scene
- Three.js runs in all browsers supported by WebGL 1.0.
- Three.js is made available under the MIT License.

## Where can we use Three.js?

As long as the device supports WebGL, you can use Three.js in the same manner you would a canvas, including full-screen animations.WebGL is supported by all modern browsers, 
but if you're working on a client project, you'll have to evaluate the lack of support in older versions of Internet Explorer and Android.

## Why we use Three.js?

- We can readily watch the source code and learn the functionality of Three.js because it is open source (functions).
- When we use WebGL for graphics, we don't get support for the majority of browsers, but Three.js does.
- The code does not require any third-party plugins to run.
- Only one programming language, JavaScript, and, of course, HTML, are required.

## Who uses three.js?

126 companies reportedly use three.js in their tech stacks, including:
- Scale
- Foretag
- Teespring
- NetApp
- Eazel Web Service
- Clovis
- WILD
- Amazon Robotics
