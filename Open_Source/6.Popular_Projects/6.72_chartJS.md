    Simple yet flexible JavaScript charting for designers & developers
</p>
<br>
<hr>

**Chart.js** is a free open-source  JavaScript library for data visualization, which supports *8* chart types: **bar, line, area, pie (doughnut), bubble, radar, polar, and scatter**. Created by London-based web developer **Nick Downie** in 2013, now it is maintained by the community and is the second most popular JS charting library on GitHub by the number of stars after D3.js, considered significantly easier to use though less customizable than the latter. Chart.js renders in HTML5 canvas and is widely covered as one of the best data visualization libraries. It is available under the **MIT license**.
