# Gitpod

Gitpod is an open-source Kubernetes application for ready-to-code developer environments that spins up fresh, automated dev environments for each task, in the cloud, in seconds. It enables you to describe your dev environment as code and start instant, remote and cloud-based developer environments directly from your browser or your Desktop IDE.

It is a container-based development platform which puts developer experience first. Gitpod provides ready-to-code developer environments in the cloud which is accessible through your browser and your local IDE.
