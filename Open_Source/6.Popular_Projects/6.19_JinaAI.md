## Why use Jina to build a neural search?

Jina is an open-source deep learning-powered search framework for building cross-/multi-modal search systems (e.g. text, images, video, audio) on the cloud. Essentially, it lets you build a search engine for any kind of data with any kind of data.

So you could build your own text-to-text search engine ala Google, a text-to-image search engine ala Google Images, a video-to-video search engine and so on. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Spotify build these searches powered by state-of-the-art AI-powered models like FAISS, DistilBERT and Annoy.
