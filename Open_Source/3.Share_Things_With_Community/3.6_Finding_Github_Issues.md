## Finding Github Issues
Hey! Are you looking for Contributing in Projects on Github but not able
to find them easily as per your tech skills then you should try to
understand how github searchbar works. It is one of the most helpful
tool in Github. Let\'s understand how it engages and helps in finding
relevant issues.

On the Home page, you can easily navigate to the Issues tab and you will
see something like this:

Now, you won\'t find any issues if you haven\'t created any. But if you
look at the search bar, you will find the reason why it is empty or why
there are only the issues that you have created. You will see that in
the search bar there is a filter called `author:Username` , which
filters the issues which are created by you. You definitely don\'t want
this as you want to search and find other issues by other
people/communities. So, simply remove the text `author:Username` from
the search bar. Keep rest as it is for now. Now if you press enter after
removing the author filter, you will see all the issues on GitHub.

There will be a ton of them, very random in terms of programming
languages, frameworks, projects, difficulty, type, etc. they are
basically the issues created recently on GitHub.

Now, the `is:open` Label is indicating wheather the issue is open or
not. It will filter all the open issues available in github so you can
easily differentiate between the issues that were closed either because
the issue got solved or it was irrelevent.

The `is:archieved` label is indicating whether the issue consisting
repository is archieved or not. If the arguement is
**false** then it simply means the repository is
still active otherwise it is considered to be inactive.

We can filter the issues as `language:name` This will filter the issues
which have this language in their codebase.

For Example :

Here, I have filtered the issues which have language as 
**Javascript**, you can use any language/tool you
might want and would love to find some interesting projects to
contribute and learn from.

If you want to search by multiple programming languages you can separate
the names of those programming languages by a comma ,.

You can also separate programming languages with space and enclosing all
of them under double quotes `""`.

## Add labels

You can find issues as per labels marked on them, many issues have a
label marked on them to improve their visibility and meta-information
about the issue.

We have some labels which GitHub has created already for common
scenarios in projects.

-   bug
-   documentation
-   duplicate
-   enhancement
-   good first Issue
-   help wanted
-   invalid
-   question
-   wontfix

We can even create our own labels by providing the label name and a
description.

To search for labels, you can use `label:name` of the label. You can any
of the above 9 label tags or any other tag name that you think is
popular other than those 9.

You would have to use double quotes `("")` to add certain labels with
multiple words like `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

Now you can go ahead and start applying the filters on issues and make
some contributions to Open-Source on GitHub. We covered some methods to
find and filter out the issues on GitHub based on the programming
languages/tools and the labels attached to them.

This technique can be good for beginners as well as people who want to
find quick issues to solve. Feel free to explore and try out different
filters and find the issue you are confident to work on. Good Luck!
Happy Coding :)
