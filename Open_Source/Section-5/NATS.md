# What is NATS

<p>
    NATS is a connective technology that powers modern distributed systems. A connective technology is responsible for addressing, discovery and exchanging of messages that drive the common patterns in distributed systems; asking and answering questions, aka services/microservices, and making and processing statements, or stream processing.
  
  Modern distributed systems are defined by an ever increasing number of hyper-connected moving parts and the additional data they generate. They employ both services and streams to drive business value.
  
  They are also being defined by location independence and mobility, and not just for things we would typically recognize as front end technologies. Todayâ€™s systems and the backend processes, microservices and stream processing are being asked to be location independent and mobile as well, all while being secure.
