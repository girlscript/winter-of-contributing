    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Why is CNCF needed?
        Companies are realizing that they need to be a software company, even if they are not in the software business.
        For example, Airbnb is revolutionizing the hospitality industry and more traditional hotels are struggling to
        compete. Cloud native allows IT and software to move faster. Adopting cloud native technologies and practices
        enables companies to create software in-house, allows business people to closely partner with IT people, keep up
        with competitors and deliver better services to their customers. CNCF technologies enable cloud portability
        without vendor lock-in.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    Cloud Native Ambassadors (CNAs) are individuals who are passionate about Cloud Native Computing Foundation
    technology and projects, recognized for their expertise, and willing to help others learn about the framework and
    community.

    Successful ambassadors are people such as bloggers, influencers, evangelists who are already engaged with a CNCF
    project in some way including contributing to forums, online groups, community events, etc.

    The Cloud Native Ambassador program exists to empower community members with tools and resources needed to:

    Promote cloud native projects and technology
    Educate a local community on the CNCF mission
    Contribute to CNCF projects
