## HISTORY OF DATA SCIENCE
 
- We define Data Science as a methodology by which actionable insights can be inferred from data.

- In simple words, data scientists just try to get insights from massive amounts of data that can help companies make smarter business decisions.

## **Evolution:**

  - Historically, data was evaluated manually which used to take a lot of time and concluded with errors, but nowadays it is automated, and the number of errors has also reduced. With the growth of technology, the number of people dealing with data has also reduced over time. 

**Data Science has revolutionized several different aspects of our world. Let's take a look then at when and where data science comes from.**

**In 1962**, John Tukey has written  about a shift in the world of statistics

**In 1974**, Peter Naur has authored the Concise Survey of the Computer Methods

**In 1977**,  IASC, also known as International Association for Statistical Computing was  formed during this year.

**In 1977**, Sir Tukey wrote a second paper in the same year when IASC was formed, titled as Exploratory Data Analysis, arguing the importance of using data in selecting “which” hypotheses to test, and that confirmatory data analysis and exploratory data analysis should work hand-in-hand.

**In 1989**,ACM SIGKDD Conference was conducted on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, organized its first workshop.

**In 1994**,In this year the  Business Week ran the cover story, Database Marketing, revealing the ominous news companies had started gathering large amounts of personal information, with plans to start strange new marketing campaigns. 

**In 1999**, Sir Jacob Zahavi pointed out the need for new tools to handle the massive amounts of information available to businesses.

**In 2001**, A  new Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) was created. This was the pre-cursor to using Cloud-based applications.

**In 2001**,Sir  William S. Cleveland laid out plans for training Data Scientists to meet the needs of the future. 

**In 2002**,International Council for Science: Committee on Data for Science and Technology began publishing the Data Science Journal

**In 2006**,the companies like Hadoop 0.1.0, an open-source, non-relational database, was released. 

**In 2008**, the title, “Data Scientist” became a very sensational word, and eventually a part of the language.

**In 2009**, the term NoSQL was reintroduced by Johan Oskarsson

**In 2011**, job listings for Data Scientists were increased by 15,000%. 

**In 2011**, People like James Dixon, CTO of Pentaho promoted the concept of Data Lakes, rather than Data Warehouses. 

**In 2013**, the company IBM shared statistics showing 90% of the data in the world had been created within the last two years.

**In 2015**, they used Deep Learning techniques, Google’s speech recognition, Google Voice, experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49 percent.

**In 2015**,sir  Bloomberg’s Jack Clark, wrote that it had been a landmark year for Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## **Transition:**

- When we look into the statistics of the careers chosen by people in the past few years, data science is massively adopted by people even from non-technical backgrounds and is doing wonders.


- Data Science has become an important part of business and academic research. Technically, this includes machine translation, robotics, speech recognition, the digital economy, and search engines. In terms of research areas, Data Science has expanded to include the biological sciences, health care, medical informatics, the humanities, and social sciences. Data Science now influences economics, governments, and business and finance.


## Real-Time scenario:
- In the past ten years, Data Science has quietly grown to include businesses and organizations world-wide. It is now being used by governments, geneticists, engineers, and even astronomers. During its evolution, Data Science’s use of Big Data was not simply a “scaling up” of the data, but included shifting to new systems for processing data and the ways data gets studied and analyzed.

- Data Science is seen as a bright field as it has applications all over, ranging from Automobile Industry, IT sector, Healthcare, Army and Weapons, Power and Energy, Banking, and Finance. 
- Some of the real-time applications are, it helps in detecting whether the mail is spam or ham, money transaction is fraud or not, detecting the simplest and busiest air routes, recommendations in amazon and Netflix. 
- It is chosen in many companies, as it helps in summarizing the efficiency of working of the company.



## **It’s future:**

  - The advantage of Data science is, it helps in decision making with less time. We are in an era where time plays a vital role, we always look for an accurate decision. Hence, Data Science is making our life easy and supportive with accurate and efficient results. So data science isn’t the end, it’s a beginning of a new era.
