come into play, they make our life easy and help us work more efficiently by cutting down a major part of our task. 

# Which libraries to use?  
As CSS libraries are very much in demand there are tons of libraries that are used bt developers these days some of the most popular ones are: 
### 1.Bootstrap
 When using Bootstrap, designers can just write out their HTML code, include the relevant CSS classes which are pre defined in bootstrap with different styling, and achieve website responsiveness. They donâ€™t have to spend time adjusting for browser incompatibility, CSS positioning, and the like.
 Also Bootstrap is one of the biggest repo in github so you can have lots of fun exploring about it. 

 ### 2.Tailwind
 The problem in bootstrap is the vast amount of classes.
 With Tailwind CSS, users can cut down on having to name too many classes. It comes with common utility patterns to deal with standard requirements: specifying and organizing classes, cascading classes, etc. In simple terms, creating custom components become so much easier. 

 ### 3.Foundation 
Along with offering UI components, Foundation also comes with a responsive image system, a pricing table, responsive embeds, form validation and much more. This gives the developers to boost their creativity and ease out the creation of user friendly UI.  

### 4.Bulma 
Bulma is a framework based on Flexbox. It makes the layout of the design easier to formulate and provides simple and modern user experience. To top it off users can import only the components that they need.

### 5.Skeleton 
The main plus point of skeleton is that you can go thorough their entire source code in 30 mins, afterall it's only 400 lines of code.Which makes it dead simple to use and understand but don't mistake it as the weaker of the lot, it was made with keeping in mind the mobile integration of the websites and majority of the population surf internet through mobile phones these days so it comes in real handy.
