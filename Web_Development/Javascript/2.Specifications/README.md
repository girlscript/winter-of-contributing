# The History of JavaScript

JavaScript is one of the most in-demand language, and for the seventh year in a row, it has been ranked the most commonly used programming language, with 67.8% of developers employing it in 2019. Its ascent to the world’s most popular programming language is synonymous with the rise of the internet itself.

Created out of necessity, it is used to build 95.2% (1.52 billion) of websites today, including some of the world’s largest, like Facebook and YouTube. Without it, we would not have popular and useful web apps such as Google Maps and eBay. 



# Javascript Specification (ECMA-262)

In 1997, due to JavaScript’s rapid growth, it became clear that the language would need to be properly maintained and managed. Therefore, Netscape handed the job of creating a language specification to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), a body founded with the goal of standardizing computing. The ECMA specifications were labeled ECMA-262 and ECMAScript languages included JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript.

Between 1997 and 1999, ECMA-262 had three revisions, but nearly 10 years later, version 4 was abandoned due to differing opinions on the direction of the language and its proposed features. Interestingly, many of these controversial features, such as generators, iterators, and destructuring assignments, have been included in more recent ECMAScript specifications.



# ECMAScript Specification

ECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript. ECMAScript standardized by the ECMA International standards organization in the ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 specifications. JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java.

ECMA-262 is a standard published by Ecma International. It specifies a general-purpose scripting language. The language is called ECMAScript. The ECMAScript standard defines the rules, details, and guidelines that the scripting language must observe to be considered ECMAScript compliant.




# Versions of ECMAScript:

-**1st Edition**
    Launched in June 1997.

-**2nd Edition**
    Launched exactly after 1 year complition of 1st Edition launch, in June 1998.

-**3rd Edition**
    Launched in December 1999. Added some new features. Regular expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric output, and other enhancements.

-**4th Edition**
    Fourth Edition was abandoned, due to political differences concerning language complexity. Many features proposed for the Fourth Edition have been completely dropped; some were incorporated into the sixth edition.

-**5th Edition**
    Launched in December 2009. Adds "strict mode," a subset intended to provide more thorough error checking and avoid error-prone constructs. Clarifies many ambiguities in the 3rd edition specification, and accommodates behaviour of real-world implementations that differed consistently from that specification. Adds some new features, such as getters and setters, library support for JSON, and more complete reflection on object properties.

-**5.1 Edition**
    Launched in June 2011, this edition 5.1 of the ECMAScript standard is fully aligned with the third edition of the international standard ISO/IEC 16262:2011.

-**6th Edition**
    The 6th edition, ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015, was finalised in June 2015.This update adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications, including class declarations (class Foo { ... }), ES6 modules like import * as moduleName from "..."; export const Foo, but defines them semantically in the same terms as ECMAScript 5 strict mode. As the first "ECMAScript Harmony" specification, it is also known as "ES6 Harmony."

-**7th Edition**
    The 7th edition, or ECMAScript 2016, was finalised in June 2016. Its features include block-scoping of variables and functions, destructuring patterns (of variables), proper tail calls, exponentiation operator ** for numbers, await, async keywords for asynchronous programming (as a preparation for ES2017), and the Array.prototype.includes function.

-**8th Edition**
    The 8th edition, or ECMAScript 2017, was finalised in June 2017. Its features include the Object.values, Object.entries and Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors functions for easy manipulation of Objects, async/await constructions which use generators and promises, and additional features for concurrency and atomics.

-**9th Edition**
    The 9th edition, or ECMAScript 2018, was finalised in June 2018.[14] New features include the spread operator, rest parameters, asynchronous iteration, Promise.prototype.finally and additions to RegExp.[14]

    The spread operator allows for the easy copying of object properties, as shown below.

    let object = {a: 1, b: 2}
    
    let objectClone = Object.assign({}, object) // before ES9
    let objectClone = {...object} // ES9 syntax
    
    let otherObject = {c: 3, ...object}
    console.log(otherObject) // -> {c: 3, a: 1, b: 2}

-**10th Edition**
    The 10th edition, or ECMAScript 2019, was published in June 2019. Added features include, but are not limited to, Array.prototype.flat, Array.prototype.flatMap, changes to Array.sort and Object.fromEntries.

-**11th Edition**
    The 11th edition, or ECMAScript 2020, was published in June 2020. In addition to new functions, this version introduces a BigInt primitive type for arbitrary-sized integers, the nullish coalescing operator, and the globalThis object.

-**12th Edition**
    The 12th edition, or ECMAScript 2021, was published in June 2021. This version introduces the replaceAll method for strings, a promise combinator that short-circuits when an input value is fulfilled, AggregateError, a new error type to represent multiple errors at once, logical assignment operators (??=, &&=, ||=), WeakRef, for referring to a target object without preserving it from garbage collection, and FinalizationRegistry, to manage registration and unregistration of cleanup operations performed when target objects are garbage collected, separators for numeric literals (1_000) and Array.prototype.sort was made more precise, reducing the amount of cases that result in an implementation-defined sort order.

-**ES.Next**
    ES.Next is a dynamic name that refers to whatever the next version is at the time of writing. ES.Next features include finished proposals (aka "stage 4 proposals") as listed at finished proposals that are not part of a ratified specification. The language committee follows a "living spec" model, so these changes are part of the standard, and ratification is a formality.




# Advantages:

- **Speed**: Client-side JavaScript is very fast because it can be run immediately within the client-side browser. Unless outside resources are required, JavaScript is unhindered by network calls to a backend server.

- **Simplicity**: JavaScript is relatively simple to learn and implement.

- **Popularity**: JavaScript is used everywhere on the web.

- **Interoperability**: JavaScript plays nicely with other languages and can be used in a huge variety of applications.

- **Server Load**: Being client-side reduces the demand on the website server.

- **Interface**: Gives the ability to create rich interfaces.
