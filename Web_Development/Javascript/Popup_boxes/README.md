## What and why?
#### What is Javascript?

#### What are Popup boxes?
- Javascript provides features such as popup boxes to display a message and to interact with the user and there are three types of popup boxes which are used in different situations.
1. Alert Box: It is used when a warning message is to displayed to the user. When a user clicks on anything on the webpage and if the popup box functionality is added to the object. A rectangular box is displayed on the top mid side of the webpage. The developer can add any message to be displayed in the popup box. Following is the code to add popup box functionality to a button. On clicking the button a alert box is displayed. The alert("") function helps us.
```
<html>
    <body>
        <script>
            function showAlert() {
                alert("Hi, this is an Alert box");
            }
