#### Different Types of Opeartor
Javascript has different types of opeartor to do specific task with values.

- Assignment Operators 
- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Logical Operators
- String Operators
- Ternary/ Conditional Operators
- Comma Operators
- Unary Operators
- Relational Operators
  
### [Assignment Operators](AssignmentOperator.md#assignment-operator)
An Assignment Operators are those operators that assign values to left operand based on valeus of the right operand.


|Operator |Meaning       |Description                                           |
|---------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
|a = b    | a = b        |Assigns the value of b to a                           |
|a += b   | a = a + b    |Assigns the results of a + b to a                     |
|a -= b   | a = a - b    |Assigns the results of a - b to a                     |
|a *= b   | a = a * b    |Assigns the results of a * b to a                     |
|a /= b   | a = a / b    |Assigns the results of a / b to a                     |
|a %= b   | a = a % b    |Assigns the results of a % b to a                     |
|a **= b  | a = a ** b   |Assigns the results of a to the power b to a          |
|a <<= b  | a = a << b   |Assigns the results of a shifted left side by b to a  |
|a >>= b  | a = a >> b   |Assigns the results of a shifted right side by b to a |
|a &= b   | a = a & b    |Assigns the results of a AND b to a                   |
|a ^= b   | a = a ^ b    |Assigns the results of a XOR b to a                   |
