# Ternary/ Conditional Operators
[Back to Operators in Javascript](../README.md#operators-in-javascript)


The conditional operator is a ternary operator that is used to evaluate a condition and return a result.

```js
var result = condition ? trueValue : falseValue;
```
If the condition is true, the trueValue is returned, otherwise the falseValue is returned.

Example
```js
var result = (5 > 2) ? "5 is greater than 2" : "5 is not greater than 2";
console.log(result); // 5 is greater than 2
```
