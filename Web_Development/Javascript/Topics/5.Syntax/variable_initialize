<h1 align = "center"> Difference between const, var and let </h1>

Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable.

  _There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:_
   - Using var
   - Using let
   - Using const

   **var** :
   Variables declared using var keyword scoped to the current execution context. This means if they are inside a function we only can access them inside the function and if they are not, they are part of the global scope which we can access anywhere. 

   One of the issues with using the var keyword is they can be redeclared inside the same scope. This will brings up some serious issues if we declare another variable using the same name inside the same scope, the new variable will replace the old one. var can be updated as well.

   **let** :
  This is the improved version of var declarations. Variables declaration using this way eliminates all the issues that we discussed earlier. let creates variables that are block-scoped. Also, they can not be redeclared and can be updated. 

  _concluding let_ :
  - Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.

 - Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.

 - Variables defined with let have Block Scope.

 **const** :
 Const variables are cannot be updated or redeclared. This way is used to declare constants. Same as the let declarations const declarations are block-scoped. Unlike var and let, if we are using const to declare a variable that must be initialized.
 If we use const when object creating we can still update properties inside that object. Refer to the below example for better understanding.

 _concluding const_ :
 - Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.

- Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.

- Variables defined with const have Block Scope.
