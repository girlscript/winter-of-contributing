# Data Types in JavaScript

Just like any other programming language, JavaScript has data types too, however they might be different in their behaviour and properties unlike data types in other programming languages.

## Primitive Types
---
JavaScript has 5 main primitive types :

- String
- Boolean
- Number
- Null and Undefined
- BigInt

*Note: Objects in JavaScript are a collection of properties and is not considered under Primitive types*

## String Type
---
String type is used to represent textual data / information in JavaScript. It is a set of elements where each element occupies a position in the String. The first element is at 0th index, the next at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements in it.
Single quotes or double quotes may be used to assign a value to a string variable.

Example:

```js
    let str = 'javascript';
```

*Note: In JavaScript Strings are immutable, that means once they are created we cannot modify the same*

## Boolean Type
---
Boolean type in JavaScript represents two values, logical true (or 1) or logical false (or 0)

Example:

```js
    let isGameOver = true;
    isGameOver = 0;
```

## Number Type
---
JavaScript has only one number type. Decimals, Integers, Whole numbers all are represented using a single type called Number. Unlike, other programming languages, JavaScript doesn't have different data types for different types of numbers.

Example:

```js
    let x = 12.34;
    let y = 123;
    let negativeNumber = -34;
```

## Null Type
---
The Null type represents the intentional absence of a value in Javascript. It is a primitive type and is treated as falsy for boolean operations.

Example:

```js
    let value = null;
```

## Undefined Type
---
The Undefined type in JavaScript is its way of saying, it doesn't know what's present inside something or if something is not defined. For example a variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.

Example:

``` js
    let x; // x is not assigned any value
    typeof(x); // hence, it's type is undefined
```

## BigInt
---
BigInt is a special and a new numeric type in JavaScript which provides support for integers of arbitrary length.

A bigint could be created by :

- Appending n to the end of an integer literal 
- Calling the function BigInt

Example:

``` js
    const bigint = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n; // by appending n at the end
    const newBigint = BigInt("1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"); // by calling BigInt function
```

## Objects
---
An object in JavaScript is a collection of related data and/or functionality consisting of variables and functions â€” which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects.

Example:

``` js
    let person = {
        firstName:"John", // each of these are a property consisting of a key-value pair
        lastName:"Doe", 
        age:50, 
        eyeColor:"blue"};
```
