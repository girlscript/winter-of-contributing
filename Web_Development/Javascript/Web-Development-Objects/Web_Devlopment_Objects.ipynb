        "To understand this clearly let's think of some real world examples such as motorbike. We can consider motorbike as an object in real world and we often use the term \"property\" and \"functioning\" to differentiate one motorbike from others. Properties such as brand, color, body design, posture of motorbike, etc. And motorbike also performs some functioning like applingBrake(), accelerate() which defines the working of the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now taking the above example of motorbike as consideration, We can easily understand objects in Javascript, they are more or less as same as that motorbike having different values and properties. In javascript objects consist of **values** instead of properties and **methods** in place of functioning. \n",
        "> Example- Object named person will be consisting of some values like name, age and methods like setSchoolName(), setNickName().\n",
        "\n",
        "So we can conclude that in javascript, Object consist of pair of values and may contain some methods as well. "

        "\n",
        "The first term `key` represents the name of property of the object which should be declared in left side and the second term `value` contains the data related with its adjacent key which must be assigned at right side of corresponding keys.\n",

        "* We had used `first_name` instead of `first name` because in every programing language space is counted as delimiter. So you have to be very careful from doing this mistake;\n",
        "* Strings should be wrapped either in ' '(single quotes) or in \" \"(double quotes);\n",
