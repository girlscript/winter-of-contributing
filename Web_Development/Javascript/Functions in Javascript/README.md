## Functions in Javascript

A function in JavaScript is a block of reusable code that can be used multiple times instead of rewriting the same code. A function definition usually contains the function name, 
a list of parameteres within paranthesis separated by commas, and some code within the function body. We can call a function whenever we need to execute it. Variables declared 
inside functions, however, cannot be accessed outside the function since it is outside the function scope. Apart from user-defined functions, we also have predefined functions 
that we can use. In JavaScript, we also have a special way of writing functions known as an arrow function which helps us write shorter code.
