## Javascript stack

The Javascript call stack is mainly used while calling functions. Execution of functions is synchronous in the call stack. This is quite similar to the stack data structure which follows 
a similar LIFO principle. An understanding of how the Javascript call stack works gives us an insight onto function hierarchy and their order of execution. Due to multiple 
function calls, we might run out of space in the stack and this is known as 'stack overflow'.
