# <strong>INTEGRATING OTHER PEOPLE'S LIBRARIES</strong>

One of the beauties of coding in the modern era is that many people share their code so that we can benefit from their work, cost-free. 

There are so many things we could integrate. There are literally hundreds of thousands of libraries for JavaScript. Let us look at a few of them:

## jQuery
<hr>
jQuery is probably the most popular JavaScript library out there which provides so many features for modern-day development. <br>
You can use jQuery API for event handling, animation and manipulating of the HTML document, also known as DOM. Besides this, jQuery is being used with Angular and React App building tools too. In short, one of the must-know JavaScript library for web development.

## Vue.js
<hr>
Vue.js is another open-source progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, similar to React. <br>
The USP of Vue.js is its adaptability, integration into projects that use other JavaScript libraries is very easy with Vue because it is designed to be incrementally adoptable.

## React JS
<hr>
React is Facebook’s component-based web development framework for making UIs and offering declarative views, which makes the code more predictable and easier to debug. <br>
It does not support controllers or models. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native. In short, it allows you to build powerful, fast, user-friendly and reactive web apps.

## Node.js
<hr>
Node.js or Node JS is another powerful JavaScript framework which allows you to develop a server-side component using JavaScript.
The biggest advantage of Node JS is that now you can develop a web application end-to-end using just JavaScript.
It’s also free and runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.) Node.js uses an asynchronous, event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
Node.js’ package ecosystem, npm, is also the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world. 

## Ember.js
<hr>
Ember.js is another popular, open-source JavaScript web framework which is based on the Model and View pattern. <br>
It allows developers to create scalable single-page web applications by incorporating common idioms and best practices into the framework itself.
It has integrated features like templates also known as handlebars that helps in writing less code and have the ability to update themselves with a change in data. Ember.js can be installed via NPM.

## Angular
<hr>
Angular previously known as Angular JS is a single web development framework developed by Google for both desktop and mobile web applications.
Angular aims at creating progressive web apps by offering dependency injection that helps in data service assembly for applications while an HTML template that is used for composing templates. <br>
Angular also has a powerful ecosystem that includes four data libraries and support in IDEs.

## Webix
<hr>
Webix is a multi-widget JS UI framework that focuses on cross-platform web development. <br>
Its complex widgets are ready to be integrated into any solution. Webix operates easily in the Angular, React, Vue.js, and Meteor environment. <br>
It’s not free and it may cost some money for commercial use but there is a free open-source version. The library includes detailed documentation, sufficient study materials, and professional technical support.


### These are few of the famous and most widely used Javascript Libraries.
In addition to these there are other libraries like Backbone.js and so on. However, these libraries are not so widely used.
