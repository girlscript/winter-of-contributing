# Iteration  Statements in JavaScript

**Iteration Statements:**  An iteration statement, or loop, repeatedly executes a statement, known as the loop body, until the controlling 
expression is false (0).

## JavaScript supports 7 iteration statements
 
* While Loop 
* Do-while Loop 
* For Loop 
* For-each Loop 
* Map  
* For-in Loop 
* For-of Loop 

### While Loop

while loop is one of the most basic kind of loops available in JS. If JavaScript is not the only programming language you know, you must have
heard about this one already.

The while statement generates a loop that gets executed over a particular block of statement (code) as long as the condition is true. Every time
before executing the block of code the condition gets checked.

**Syntax:**

```js
while (condition) {
  Block of code
}
```

**Flowchart:**

**Example:**

```js
var i=8;
while (i<10){
 console.log("I is less than 10");
 i++;
}
```

**Output:** 

I is less than 10

I is less than 10

... 10 times

In the above example, the condition is getting checked if the value of i is less than 10 or not. If the condition is true, the block of code gets executed and before iterating next time the value of i is getting increases by 1 as we’ve added a statement i++.

### Do-while Loop

do-while loop is slightly different from while as it includes one extra feature. In case of do-while loop, the block of code gets executed at 
least once and if further the condition satisfies the code block will be executed accordingly.

**Syntax:**

```js
do {
    Block of code
 }
while (condition);
```

**Flowchart:**

**Example:**

```js
var i=7;
do{
    console.log("The value of i is " + i);
    i++;
}
while(i>7 && i<10);
```

**Output:** 

The value of i is 7

The value of i is 8

The value of i is 9

the value of i is greater than 7 but less than 10; but in output the value of i=7 has been printed. Because this looping technique first do 
execute the code irrespective of the condition and then compares the condition from 2nd round of execution. For all the true condition from 
the 2nd looping round the code block will be executed.

### For Loop

 In case of for loop the declaration & initialization of looping variable, condition checking & increment or decrements of the looping variable
 can be done in the same line. It increases the readability & reduces the chances of error.

**Syntax:**

```js
for ([initialization];[condition];[final-expression]){
   Block of code
}
```

**Flowchart:**

**Example:**

```js
for (var i=0; i<10; i++){
    console.log("The Value of i Is " + i);
}
```

**Output:** 

The Value of i Is 0

The Value of i Is 1

...

The Value of i Is 9

Take a look at the above example, the initialization, condition & increment has been declared in a single line. It’s easier to understand 
and better readable

### For-each Loop

It is a prototypal method of Array (Even Map and Set). The forEach() method calls a given function/callback every time with each element in an
array, according to the index order. Take note, forEach() does not run the given function for array elements having no values.

**Working of switch statement**

The forEach() method takes a function as an argument. The function consists of three parameters mentioned above.

-the currentValue holds the present value being processed.
-the index variable holds the index of the value in that particular array.
-and the array variable holds the total array passed.

You can iterate over a set using forEach().
map can also be iterated using forEach() method.

**Syntax:**

```js
arrayName.forEach(function(currentValue, index, array){
    function body
})
```

**Example:**

```js
var arr=[10, 20, "hi", ,{}];

arr.forEach(function(item, index){
    console.log(' arr['+index+'] is '+ item);
});
```

**Output:** 

arr[0] is 10

arr[1] is 20

arr[2] is hi

arr[4] is [object Object]

### Map

map is another prototypal method of Array. The map() method creates a new array having the returned values generated by a function execution 
over a given array.

**Syntax:**

```js
var newArray= oldArray.map(function (currentValue, index, array){
    //Return element for the newArray
});
```

**Example:**

```js
var num = [1, 5, 10, 15];
var doubles = num.map(function(x) {
   return x * 2;
});
```

**Output:** 

In the above example the new array named doubles will be filled with the outputs doubles=[2, 10, 20, 30] and num array is still [1, 5, 10, 15].

### For-in Loop

This one has been developed mainly to iterate over the properties of an object. The for...in statement iterates over the enumerable properties of
an object. For each distinct property, statements can be executed.

**Syntax:**

```js
for (variableName in object) {
    Block of code
}
```

**Example:**

```js
var obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};    
for (var prop in obj) {
    console.log('obj.'+prop+'='+obj[prop]);
};
```

**Output:** 

obj.a=1

obj.b=2

obj.c=3

The `for...in loop mainly iterates over the enumerable properties of an object in the actual insertion order.

### For-of Loop

This one is the most recent looping type included in JS, introduced in ES6. Using for...of statement you can iterate over any iterable object like
Array, String, Map, WeakMap, Set, WeakSet, arguments object, TypedArray and even general objects (pojo).

**Syntax:**

```js
for (variable of iterable) {
  Block of code
}
```

**Example:**

```js
var str= 'paul';
for (var value of str) {
console.log(value);
}
```

**Output:** 

"p"

"a"

"u"

"l"

The for...of statement iterates over the given values (not property names) of any iterable object.
