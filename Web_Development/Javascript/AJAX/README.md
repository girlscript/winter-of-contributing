Asynchronous Javascript and XML is a set of technologies that allows us to bring improvements to the UI and UX of a webpage. XML (Extensible Markup Language) is used for storing 
and transporting data. XML is being gradually replaced by JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) which is much easier to read than XML. Asynchronous JavaScript allows us to perform 
multiple tasks at the same time and thus allows quick UI updates. While writing asynchronous code, often our code gets unmanageable due to repeated usage of .then() and .catch() 
methods. This is where the Fetch API comes in. A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Asynchronous functions always 
return a promise. A promise can have three states-resolved, rejected and pending. The Fetch API allows us to use these promises to write clean and manageable code.
