# Contribution Guide for MERN

- **Must Follow : [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/girlscript/winter-of-contributing/blob/MERN/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) & [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/girlscript/winter-of-contributing/blob/MERN/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct) before start Contributing.**
- Changes should be made inside the MERN/ directory & MERN branch.

## Guidelines
1. Pull requests (hereby referred to as PRs) and commits
   must be kept as granular and atomic as possible. PRs with
   too many commits will be squashed before merge. The commit
   messages must be clear and comprehensible.
2. All PRs must be reviewed and approved by **atleast 2** mentors
   before the supervisor gets to go ahead and do the final
   review and merge/close.
3. Any important suggestions must be brought to the immediate notice
   of the mentors and/or the supervisor.
4. All code-blocks present in Markdown must be appropriately represented in the files.
   
   Example: 
   ```` md
   ```jsx
   // Your code goes here
   console.log('Hello World!');
   ```
   ````

   or any suitable formats. 
5. Contributions should be attributed by the author.
   - Document-based contributions may mention the names of the contributors
     at the end of the Markdown file.
   - Video/Audio-based contributions may mention the names of the contributors
     immediately next to where the URLs are mentioned.

- Each issue will uniquely identify a single topic/sub-topic.
- Every issue must have a checklist representing what kind of contributions are left undone (document, audio, video).
- Since a PR resolves and closes an issue, it'll manually be reopened after each kind of contribution is done. That's just fair, because multiple forms of contributions revolving the same issue would still require changing the same files, which isn't possible.
- For each topic, we'll first accept a document-based contribution before accepting any video/audio contribution.
- As long as we're not out of options, one contributor may contribute to one topic only in one format i. e. Either document, video, or audio, but not multiple.
- Although more issues will be generated, if you find an issue having been assigned to too many contributors already, I recommend you to:
  1. Look for other issues,.
  2. Request contribution to the same issue for a different format (document, audio, video).
  3. Create your own issue and request the tag from me (you may reference the roadmap).
- There will be a soft limit on the number of issues a single person may work simultaneously on.
