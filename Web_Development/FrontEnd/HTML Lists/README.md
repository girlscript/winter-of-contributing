## HTML Lists

HTML lists are used by web developers for grouping of similar data. In total, there are three kinds of lists-unordered list, ordered list and description list. An unordered list 
can be used for displaying unordered data. For example, this can be the names of fruits that we can find during winter. An ordered list on the other hand represents ordered data. 
For example, we can use an ordered list to display a set of instructions. Description lists are the third type of lists which contain dictionary-style entries. This can be used 
for purposes such as presenting a glossary.
