# Pseudo-elements

**Pseudo-Element** is a property which when added to a selector gives you functionality to style a specific part of the selected element(s) differently. For example, ::first-letter element can be used to change the first letter of a paragraph.

```
/* This will change first letter of every <p> element to red color and font-size to extra large. */
p::first-letter {
  color: red;
  font-size: xx-large;
}
```

CSS classes can also be used with pseudo-elements âˆ’
```
selector.class:pseudo-element {
  property: value
}
```


**Note:** [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) are also used to style elements based on their *state*.

## Syntax

```    
selector::pseudo-element{
  property: value;
}  
```
You can use only one pseudo-element for a selector. It must appear after the simple selectors in the statement.


***Note:*** As a rule, double colons (::) are preffered instead of a single colon (:). This distinguishes pseudo-classes from psedo-elements.However, since this distinction was not present in older versions of the W3C spec, most browsers support both syntaxes for the original pseudo-elements.
