# What is Web Accessibility
Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:

- perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
- contribute to the Web
<br>
<br>

### Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:

- auditory
- cognitive
- neurological
- physical
- speech
- visual
<br>
<br>

## The Four Principles of Accessibility

The principles of web accessibility are the foundations of content produced for the web and for anyone who wants to use the web : 

- **Perceivable** - Perceivability refers to the information and elements of user interface that must be presented in a manner that can be perceived by the senses and that nothing is left undetectable or invisible. To most web users, perceivability is based primarily on visuals, but for those that are unable to, sound and touch are used instead.

- **Operable** - Interactive interface elements such as controls, buttons, navigation and more should be operable. This means that a user must be able to operate interface elements by first identifying them, and for most by physically clicking, tapping, swiping, or rolling. For those that can’t interact in these ways, voice commands or the use of other assistive devices like head wands and eye trackers.

- **Understandable** - This means that technology should be clear and consistent in the presentation and format, with predictable patterns of usage and design. End users should have no issue in comprehending the meaning and purpose of the information presented in the content while discerning the user flow and operation of the interface.

- **Robust** - Robustness is the ability for content to function reliably by a wide variety of technologies, including assistive devices.

The lack of any one of these four principles will thus make the web inaccessible to users with disabilities.

## The Components of Web Accessibility
Web accessibility is an aspect that covers every element of a website. The different components of the website should be interconnected and complementary to each other to create a site that is functional and available for the benefit of those with disabilities.

### These components include:
<br>

### **Content**
Content comprises the information on a web page or web applications, such as text, images, and sounds; or the code, script, or markup that defines the structure, presentation, etc. of the site.
<br>

### **User agents**
User agents are the web browsers, mobile phone browsers, media players, plug-ins, assistive technology, and other software that acts on behalf of a user.
<br>

### **Authoring tools**
This is the software that creates websites such as code editors, content management systems, blogs, etc.

### **Evaluation tools**
Tools to help you review the effectiveness of your accessibility attributes and to help track your remediation efforts.
<br>
<br>

## Examples of Web Accessibility
<br>

### **Add alternative text (alt text) for images:** 
This can be done by adding a description of the text in the markup/code (img alt=”The Monsido logo”). Alt text is used by screen readers and other assistive technologies to read the information on the images aloud to people with visual disabilities. An alt text is also beneficial to web users who have their images turned off due to low bandwidth for example, as well as being another resource for search engine optimization. Alt text must be both short and descriptive.

<br>

For images that are purely for decorative purposes, use null alt text (img alt=””).

<br>

### **Ensure keyboard functionality:**
For people with mobility issues, fine motor issues, or even ones with temporary disabilities like broken fingers, using a mouse to navigate can be difficult. So they must be able to use a website through other means, like a keyboard. For accessible websites, all functionality is available through a keyboard. Users can tab through content or use assistive technology that mimics the keyboard navigation pattern.

<br>

### **Provide transcripts for audio:**
For those with hearing impairments, audio files like sound clips, podcasts, or even videos are inaccessible. Having a transcript of the audio content allows hearing-impaired people to consume the content
