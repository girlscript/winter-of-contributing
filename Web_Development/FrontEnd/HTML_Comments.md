# **HTML Comments**

**What are comments?**

In computer programming, a comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers 
and interpreters.

HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help to document HTML source code.

# **HTML Comment Tag**

In HTML, a comment is text enclosed within `<!╌ ╌>` tags. This syntax tells the browser that they are comments and should not be rendered on the front end.

 **why we use comments**

*   With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code.
*   comments can be use when we want to hide content temporarily.
*   Comments are also great for debugging HTML.
