## What is it?
   Hosting, in simple words, is a service through which resources are provided to an individual or organization for the maintenance and storage of websites or other related services. Hosting is something that you will require when your are creating a website. It  will provide you the storage space reqiured for storing your site's data like videos, images, applications etc.<br><img src="img/img1.jpg" width="400" align="center"><br>
   A Name Server is a server component of the DNS that returns the IP Address of a given Domain name. It handles queries regarding the location of the domain name’s various services.

 ## Web Hosting
 Web Hosting is provided by companines that rent out their technologies and services to host your website. Once the Web host hosts your website, users can access it by typing in your web address (domain name) in their browser. Their computer connects to the server your website is hosted on and the server in turn displays the stored files to your web visitor.<br>There are many Web hosts you can choose from and hence, research is required to find the ideal one for your website. You must check the Host provider's performance, security, scalability, etc.<br> So how do you go about this?
 - Decide the type of website you want to build, it could be static or dynamic. Static websites show the same content to all users while dynamic websites show contents that involve the user's activity on that website. Both these types may require different hosting features
 - Reasearch and choose a Hosting provider
 - Select a hosting plan- it could be Shared, VPS(Virtual Private Server), Cloud, etc. Refer to [this](https://websitesetup.org/different-types-of-web-hosting/) to know more.
- Come up with a Domain name for your site. You can search for available domain names [here](https://instantdomainsearch.com/search/domains).

Some of the best hosting websites are Hostinger, Bluehost and Dreamhost.

## Name Servers
Name Servers help users to access a website by typing in the domain name instead of the website's actual IP address.
Each domain name has atleast two name servers listed when it is registered. The first server is the primary server and the second one acts as a backup when the primary server fails.<br>
Name servers are the servers that make up DNS. They hold the records of multiple DNS types and help direct traffic on the internet. 
4 types of servers make up the DNS:
- Recursive/Resolver Server
- Root name Server
- TLD Name Server
- Authoritative Server
