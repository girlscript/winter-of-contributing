### **Example Explaination :-**

* The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
* The (html) element is the root element of an HTML page.
* The (head) element contains meta information about the HTML page.
* The (title) tag element specifies a title for the HTML page.
* The (body) tag element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headingsparagraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
* The (h1) tag element defines a large heading.
* The (p) tag element defines a paragraph.

## What is an HTML Element?

    An HTML file is made of elements. These elements are responsible for creating web pages and define content in that webpage. An element in HTML usually consist of a start tag <tag name>, close tag </tag name> and content inserted between them. Technically, an element is a collection of start tag, attributes, end tag, content between them.

Such as:

```javascript

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

```
    The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

```javascript

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

```

## Web Browsers :-

The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:

## History of HTML :-
<br>

    In the late 1980's , a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor at CERN, proposed a system for CERN researchers. In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system.

    Tim Berners-Lee is known as the father of HTML. The first available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags" proposed by Tim in late 1991. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which we will learn later in this tutorial.
