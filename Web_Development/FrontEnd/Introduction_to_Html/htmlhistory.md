## Introduction

HTML(Hyper-Text-Markup-Language) is the standard markup language for web pages. It is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.

A standard html code snippet looks like:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>
            ...
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>...</h1>
        <p>...</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

## History

**Tim Berners-Lee** invented the world wide web in 1989. Not more than two years later, HTML came into scene. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. 

The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999.

**XHTML** was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. It came out to be a very powerful tool as their content could easily be shared across multiple applications.

XHTML became an official standard in 2000

## Versions

The different versions of of HTML are:

1. **HTML 1.0**

    * This was the basic version of HTML with support for basic elements like text controls and images.

<br>

2. **HTML 2.0**
  
   * It was developed in 1995.

   * It introduced the concept of **forms**. Forms were developed, and included basic tags like text boxes, buttons,etc.

   * The **table tag** was developed. In HTML 2.0, browsers came with the concept of creating their own layers of tags that were specific to the browser itself.

    *  **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)** was formed. The main intention of W3C is to maintain standard across different web browsers so that the browsers understand and render HTML tags in a similar manner.
