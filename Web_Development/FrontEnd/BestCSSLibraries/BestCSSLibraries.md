## _Let's look at some of the best CSS libraries_ :sparkles:

* ### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is inevitably the *most popular* HTML, CSS, and JS library. It makes styling super easy and comes with amazing styles for buttons, drop-down menus, forms, navbars, cards, etc. that developers often use for their web pages. Even people who do not know much CSS can easily use Bootstrap, by simply following Bootstrap's well-written and easy-to-follow documentation. Check the documentation [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/). 
* ### Bulma
Bulma is a *modern* CSS library that is loved by developers worldwide. It is quite similar to Bootstrap but what sets it apart from Bootstrap is that it does not come with javascript for controlling UI elements. It focuses only on CSS, giving users freedom in terms of adding functionality to the different components like tabs, menus, etc. Check out the awesomeness of Bulma [here](https://bulma.io/).
* ### Foundation
Foundation is yet another *well-known*, *modern* and *responsive* CSS library. It is based on Flexbox and is also quite similar to Bootstrap. Its lightweight and minimal styled components can be easily customized according to the needs of the user. But unlike Bootstrap, it doesn’t have tons of support and references online being not so popular. Foundation is meant for advanced programmers and is a little complicated to use, whereas even newbies can quickly implement good web designs using Bootstrap in a couple of minutes. However, neither of the two is better than the other. Each one of them has its use cases. Check it out  [here](https://get.foundation/).
* ### Animate.css
Animate.css can help you get rid of all the mess and hard work that we face while creating *animation* for websites. It is a ready to use library that makes adding animations a lot easier. Many types of animations can be added ranging from bounce, flash, pulse to fade in, fade out, flip in, flip out, etc. Check out their documentation page [here](https://animate.style/).
* ### Loading.io
Loading.io is a library where individuals can create *animations* and use it on their websites. It offers preloaders, patterns, backgrounds, etc. and lets us animate them using various customizable effects. Loading.io also allows us to upload our own icon, backgrounds and animate them. We can also type in a text and make our very own animated text with GIF, SVG, APNG formats. Go check their website [here](https://loading.io/) to see the features they are offering.
* ### Water.css
Water.css helps to make *simplistic* but clean-looking responsive websites just by adding a few CSS functions. It has an incredibly low size (<2kb) and doesn't have classes. Check it out [here](https://watercss.kognise.dev/).
* ### Destyle.css
Till now we have seen ways to style our website, but what if we want to *reset* the stylesheet, remove margin, padding, font styles? Destyle is here for the rescue. Check it out [here](https://nicolas-cusan.github.io/destyle.css/). Another alternative to reset our stylesheet is Normalize.css. 
* ### Pure.css
Pure.css is a *lightweight*, *responsive* CSS library consisting of small modules that developers can use in every project. It is built on Normalize.css, but additionally also provides styling to some common elements that are often used. We can customize their super responsive and minimal styled menus, tables, forms according to our site's needs. Have a look at Pure.css [here](https://purecss.io/).
* ### Semantic UI
It is an UI library that helps developers to create *great-looking*, *lightweight* and *responsive* websites. It helps newbies to code with ease as its classes use natural language like syntax. It is an open-source project and has integrations with popular frameworks like React, Angular, etc. Check out their documentation page [here](https://semantic-ui.com/).
