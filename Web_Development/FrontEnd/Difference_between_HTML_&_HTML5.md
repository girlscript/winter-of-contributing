### What is HTML AND HTML5

- HTML:- 
Also known as the Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the skeleton like a human body on which different elements can fitted to make a webpage. Mainly used to design web pages. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages .The language uses tags to define what changes need to be done on the text within the tags eg:-  the p tag for displaying the content in a paragraph format, the strong tag for displaying it in a bold format. It is used for structuring and presenting the content on the web pages.
