<h1 align="center">:package: CSS Box Model</h1>
<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2> <br>
<p>
  The <b>CSS box model</b> is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. When laying out a document, the browser's rendering engine represents each element as a rectangular box according to the standard CSS box model.
  <br>
  <br>
    Every box is composed of four parts (or areas) : <b><i>Content area</i></b>, <b><i>Padding area</i></b>, <b><i>Border area</i></b>, and <b><i>Margin area</i></b>.

  <ul>
  <li><b>Content Area :</b> This area consists of content like text, image, or other media content. It is bounded by the content edge and its dimensions are given by content box width and height.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Padding Area :</b> It includes the element’s padding. This area is actually the space around the content area and within the border box. Its dimensions are given by the width of the padding-box and the height of the padding-box.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Border Area :</b> It is the area between the box’s padding and margin. Its dimensions are given by the width and height of border.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Margin Area :</b> This area consists of space between border and margin. The dimensions of margin area are the margin-box width and the margin-box height. It is useful to separate the element from its neighbors.</li>  
  </ul>

<h2>Understanding the Model</h2> <br>
<p>
  To have a clear idea of the layout and designing of web pages, you need to know how the CSS box model works.
  <br>
  <br>
  When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area. To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add padding and borders.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>NOTE:</b> The margin is not counted towards the actual size of the box — sure, it affects the total space that the box will take up on the page, but only the space outside the box. The box's area stops at the border — it does not extend into the margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li><b><i>Actual element width</i> =</b> width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border </li>
    <br>
    <li><b><i>Actual element height</i> =</b> height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  For instance, <br>
  If we assume that a box has the following CSS defining width, height, margin, border, and padding:
  <br>
</p>
  
  ```css
  .box { 
  width: 350px; 
  height: 150px; 
  margin: 10px; 
  padding: 25px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  }
  ```
  The actual space taken up by the box will be <b>410px</b> wide (350 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5) and <b>210px</b> high (150 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5).
<br>
<br>
<h2>Alternative CSS Box Model</h2> <br>
<p>
  You might think it is rather inconvenient to have to add up the border and padding to get the real size of the box, and you would be right! For this reason, CSS had an alternative box model introduced some time after the standard box model. Using this model, any width is the width of the visible box on the page, therefore the <i>content area width is that width minus the width for the padding and border</i>.
  <br>
  <br>
</p>  
By default, browsers use the standard box model. If you want to turn on the alternative model for an element, you do so by setting <code>box-sizing: border-box</code> on it. By doing this, you are telling the browser to use the border box as your defined area.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  ```css
  .box {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  
  width: 350px;
  height: 150px;
  margin: 10px; 
  padding: 25px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  }
  ```

<p>  
  <ul>
    <li><b><i>Actual element width</i> =</b> width </li>
    <br>
    <li><b><i>Actual element height</i> =</b> height </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <br>  
  Some of the well known browsers that <b>support</b> the CSS box model are :
  <br>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Chrome</li>
    <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
    <li>Safari</li>
    <li>Opera</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer</li>
  </ul>
