# **HTML Formatting**

HTML formatting is the process of transforming text into a more appealing and descriptive manner. HTML allows us the functionality to format text without the use CSS. There are lots of formatting tags available in HTML.
These formatting tags in HTML can be categorized into two parts:
<br>

- **Physical tag:** These tags are used to provide the visual appearance to the text.

- **Logical tag:** These tags are used to add some logical or semantic value to the text.

<br>

## ðŸ›  Syntax

```bash
<tag_name> formatting character or paragrah </tag_name>
```

Note: All HTML tags doesn't require closing tags, but most of the text formatting tags have closing tags.

## **âš¡ Physical Tags**

Physical Tags are used to specify how specific characters in HTML tags should be rendered or represented. Any text object, including ordinary text, graphics, line breaks, and so on, may be included in a physical style tag. Although each physical tag has its own style, you can override it by giving each tag its own look. Ending tags are required for all physical tags.

Physical Tags Have the Following Characteristics:

- They're quite easy to understand.
- They are useful in highlighting important key phrases.
- Physical Text Styles specify the sort of appearance for a segment, such as bold, italics, and so on.
- All browsers render Physical Styles in the same manner.

There are many kinds of physical tags here is the list of some of them :

## **âš¡ Logical Tags**

Logical tags are used to inform the browser about the type of text included within the tags. They differ from physical tags such that physical tags determine how the text appears but do not give any information about the text.

Some cases when we could use logical tags are:

- When we want to specify code on our website.
- When we want to draw attention to a particular passage of text.
- When the abbreviation is to be displayed on a Web page.
- When we wish to include a well-known quotation on our website.
- When we need to write a variable-based mathematical formula.

## _Heading Tag:-_

HTML headings are considered as logical tags which are defined with the h1 to h6 tags.
h1 defines the most important heading h6 defines the least important heading.
| **Header Tags** | **Visualizations** |
| :---: | :-: |
| `<h1>` | <h1>Heading 1</h1> |
| `<h2>` | <h2>Heading 2</h2> |
| `<h3>` | <h3>Heading 3</h3> |
| `<h4>` | <h4>Heading 4</h4> |
| `<h5>` | <h5>Heading 5</h5> |
| `<h6>` | <h6>Heading 6</h6> |

## _HTML Logical Style Tags Attributes:-_

Apart of the semantic functionality of the logical style tags, we have many attributes that can be used with the logical style tags to format the text in an HTML document

| **Attribute** |                               **Description**                                |
| :-----------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|    `class`    |                       Indicates a class name for a tag                       |
|     `dir`     | Indicates the directionality of text, such as left-to-right or right-to-left |
|     `id`      |                       Indicates a unique id for a tag                        |
|    `lang`     |              Indicates a language code for the content in a tag              |
|    `style`    |                    Indicates an inline style for the tag                     |
|    `title`    |                        Indicates the title for a tag                         |

## **âš¡ Resolving Common Misconceptions**

<br>

## _1. Difference between `<strong>` and `<b>` tag_

Both `<strong>` and `<b>` tags displays the enclosed text in a bold typeface by default, but the `<strong>` tag indicates that its contents have strong importance, whereas the `<b>` tag just draws the reader's attention without expressing any specific meaning.

## _2. Difference between `<em>` and `<i>` tag_

Similarly, both `<em>` and `<i>` tags displays the enclosed text in italic typeface by default, but the `<em>` tag indicates that its contents have stressed emphasis compared to surrounding text, whereas the `<i>` tag is used to separate text from the rest of the document for reading purposes, such as a technical word, an idiomatic phrase from another language, an idea, and so on.
