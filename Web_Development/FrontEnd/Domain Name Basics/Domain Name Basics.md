## ***📌What is a domain name / domain?***

A ***domain name*** or simply known as ***domain*** is a online, digital address or entity that typically takes the form of your organization's name and a standard internet suffix, for example, ***mybusiness.com or stateuniversity.edu, google.com, wikipedia.org.*** etc. These domain names are unique for a particular organisation and are associated with a physical IP address on the Internet, which in turn, is associated with a unique system connected to the internet.  For instance, the domain name `example.com` might translate to the physical address `198.102.434.8`.

<br>

It basically follows after the `@` sign in email addresses, and after `www.` in web addresses. <br>
For example, your domain is ***your-organisation.com***, and you have a website ***www.your-organisation.com*** and email at ***example@your-organisation.com.***
We can either use a domain name that you already own or we can purchase a domain suiting our needs from ***domain registrar***, which is a company that sells domain names that aren't yet owned and are therefore available for registration. Some damain name registrars are ***GoDaddy, 1&1, domain.com*** etc.

## ***📌IP Address***
An ***Internet Protocol(IP) address*** is a set of numerical instructions in the form of numbers that identifies the physical location of a particular device on the web. An IP address is a string of numbers separated by periods, expressed as a set of four numbers, each number in the set can range from `0 to 255`.
<br>
An IP address looks something like this: `74.125.19.147`. IP addresses are made up of binary values that drive the routing of all data over the Internet. There are two versions of IP that currently coexist in the global Internet: `IP version 4 (IPv4)` and `IP version 6 (IPv6)`. IP addresses are made up of binary values and drive the routing of all data over the Internet. IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, and IPv6 addresses 128 bits long.
 

<hr>

## ***📌Why a domain name?***

- ***User-friendly*** : Using a domain name to identify a location on the Internet rather than the numeric IP address makes it much easier to remember and type web addresses.
 It is an easy-to-remember name than numerical IP addresses, which are long sequences of numbers.
- ***Load balancing*** : Same name maps to changing IP addresses, Load balancing is the technique to configure a domain, as per the clients’ request, in the Domain Name System, across a distributed group of servers, i.e by providing several IP addresses for a single host or domain name. By doing so, DNS provides quicker access to a domain, thereby optimizing clients’ requests for a specific domain.
- ***Decoupling*** : Can move servers to different networks, ISP, etc

<hr>


## ***📌Domain name Vs IP Address***

An ***IP address*** communicates exact information about the address in a way that is useful to the computer but makes no sense to humans, whereas, the ***domain name*** functions as a link to the IP address. Links do not contain actual information, but they do point to the place where the IP address information resides. <br>
It is convenient to think of IP addresses as the ***actual locator*** that identifies a definite point on the internet and the domain name as a ***label*** that identifies the locator.

<hr>


## ***📌What does the domain name conveys?***
Domain names function on the Internet in a manner that each part of the domain name provides specific pieces of information, by which the web browsers locate the web page across the internet. The naming system is closely regulated in order to prevent confusion or duplicate addresses. A new Internet Protocol version, or *IPv6*, was created partly to address exponentially increasing demands for domain names.

<hr>


## ***📌Working of domain names:***
Domain names provide the users with a memorable short name. While users enter web addresses into the URL field or address bar at the top of their browser’s page from left to right, the domain name itself is read from right to left according to the ***naming hierarchy*** as follows. This link provides instructions to the network, which ultimately results in a successful response at the client end, completing the transaction.
<br><br>
One can relate to the ***namimg hierarchy*** as show in the image :

<hr>

## ***📌Parts of domain name:***
Generally a domain name `example.com`, has two essential parts, separated by a period.
<br>

- .com – This is the top-level domain(TLD).
- .example. – This is a subdomain.

Sometimes a part preceding the sub-domain is the subdomain prefix, like *www* in *www.example.com*

### ***Top-Level Domain(TLD)***

Many servers use a three-letter naming convention for top-level domains. The significance of the *top-level domain* is the most important as it identifies the highest part of the naming system used on the Internet. This naming system was originally created to identify countries and organizations as well as categories.
 
### ***Types of TLD*** 
There are mainly four types of TLDs most recognized, as administered by IANA(Interent Assigned Numbers Authority): 

- ***gTLD or Generic Top-Level Domain*** : Most recognizable TLD like .com, .net, .org, .xyz, .club, .biz, .top etc. <br>
Some other type of gTLD fall under the category of GeoTLDs including .berlin, .nyc, .moscow, .tokyo etc aiming to identify cartain geographical locations or cultures or places. The list under gTLDs is ever-increasing with new additions. To take a look at all existing gTLDs, refer to [this](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db).

- ***sTLD or Sponsored Top-Level Domain*** : These TLDs are sponsored and maintained by private businesses, organisation or the government. We need to abide by certain terms and conditions to register under a sTLD. <br>
Some common sTLDs are:
  - .edu – for educational institutions 
  - .gov – primarily for US government entities and agencies 
  - .asia – open to individuals, companies and organisations connected to the region
  - .mil – primarily US military

   Some recent additions to the sTLDs are: 
     - .travel – reserved for travel agencies 
     - .tel – reserved for internet communication service websites
     - .museum – reserved for museums

- ***ccTLD or Country Code Top-Level Domain*** are those that are specific to countries, like .in, .uk, .au, .us, .ru, .cn etc.

- ***Infrastructure Top-Level Domain*** :  There is only one domain name in this category i.e ***.arpa – Address and Routing Parameter Area***, with the help of which we can reach the root server of the name hierarchy by reverse mapping IP addresses to the domain names.
This domain is exclusively used for Internet-infrastructure purposes, particularly, the ***Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)***. Furthermore, the domain is administered by IANA under the guidance of ***IAB (Internet Architecture Board)***. 
As of September 2020, thare are 11 second-level domains under the .arpa domain name.
 
<br>


 
### ***Subdomain***
***Subdomains*** are the part of the domain system that is most recognizable to humans. There are also several levels of subdomains, and some countries developed specific conventions of the organization to communicate information within their internal naming systems.The organization of the domain name hierarchy and the ability to reserve them for only one purpose has already undergone several modifications. Discussions and debates concerning the availability and affordability of domain names can be expected to continue.
A ***subdomain*** can also be a domain that forms part of a larger domain. For example, mail.google.com, www.google.com, and docs.google.com are all subdomains of the domain google.com. Domain owners can create subdomains to provide easy-to-remember addresses for web pages or services within their top-level domain.


### ***Domain alias***
A ***domain alias*** is a domain name that acts as an alias for another domain. A domain to our account can be as a domain alias to give everyone in our domain, another email address at the domain alias. Mail sent to either of a user's addresses arrives at the user's same email inbox.

<hr>
 
## ***📌DNS***
***The Domain Name System (DNS)***, was designed to provide a distributed directory of alphabetical names that correspond to these numbers.
<br>
It is a standard, global system for translating IP addresses to human-readable domain names. Whenever a client requests to access any resources on web via web address like “example.com”, their web browser or application performs a DNS Query against a DNS server, supplying the hostname. The DNS server takes the hostname and resolves it into a numeric IP address, which the web browser can then connect to.
<br>
 
A component called a ***DNS Resolver*** is responsible for checking if the hostname is available in local cache, and if not, contacts a series of DNS Name Servers, until eventually it receives the IP of the service the client is trying to access, and returns it to the browser or application. This process usually takes less than a second.
<br><br>

<br>
This system is essentially like the “phone book” of the Web that organizes and identifies domains. While a phone book translates a name like "Peter Parker" into the correct phone number to call, the DNS maps and translates a web address like "www.google.com" into the physical IP address—such as "74.125.19.147" that is of the computer hosting that site .

### ***Some terminologies:***
- *Domain host:* 
A domain host is a company that runs the DNS servers for your domain and manages its DNS records.
 
- *Name server:* 
A name server serves as a reference point for your domain’s DNS data and is typically maintained by a domain host company. 
 
- *WHOIS directory:*
The WHOIS directory is a public listing of domain names, and the people or organizations associated with each name.
Some domain name owners might prefer to have their personal information hidden from the WHOIS directory, just as we might want your personal telephone number to be unlisted from a local telephone book.
 
<hr>
 
## ***📌WHOIS***
***WHOIS*** or shorthand for the question, ***"Who is responsible for this domain name?"*** is a widely used Internet record listing that identifies who owns a domain and how to get in contact with them. It is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block or an autonomous system, but is also used for a wider range of other information. <br>

Whenever a domain is registered, the ***International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)*** requires that these individuals, businesses or organizations provide up-to-date personal contact information to their domain registrars. This information, which may include the name, address, email, phone number and associated IP addresses, is collected and displayed in the ICANN ***WHOIS Database or WHOIS Directory***, which acts similarly to an international address book for the public. <br>

### ***What’s in the WHOIS database?***
The WHOIS database stores information about domains such as the following:
- Registration contact information for registrant, admin, and technical contacts
- Sponsoring registrar 
- Creation, update, and expiration dates
- Name servers and domain statuses

## ***📌Next we can introduce:***

- 3 types of ***DNS servers***— DNS Resolver, DNS Root Server and Authoritative Name Server
- Over 10 types of common ***DNS records***—Including A, AAAA, CNAME, MX and NS etc.

- 3 types of ***DNS queries***— Recursive, Iterative, and Non-recursive
 
## ***3 Types of DNS Servers***

Some common DNS server types that are used to resolve hostnames into IP addresses are:
- ***DNS Resolver*** : 
 A DNS resolver (recursive resolver), is designed to receive DNS queries, which include a human-readable hostname such as “www.example.com”, and is responsible for tracking the IP address for that hostname.
- ***DNS Root Server*** : 
 The root server is the first step in the journey from hostname to IP address. The DNS Root Server extracts the Top Level Domain (TLD) from the user’s query — for example, in "www.example.com", it provides details for the .com TLD Name Server. In turn, that server will provide details for domains with the .com DNS zone, including “example.com”.
There are 13 root servers worldwide, indicated by the letters A through M, maintained by different organizations like the Internet Systems Consortium, Verisign, ICANN, the University of Maryland, and the U.S. Army Research Lab.
- ***Authoritative DNS Server*** : 
 Higher level servers in the DNS hierarchy define which DNS server is the “authoritative” name server for a specific hostname, meaning that it holds the up-to-date or all necessary information for that hostname.
The Authoritative Name Server is the last stop in the name server query. It takes the hostname and returns the correct IP address to the DNS Resolver or if it cannot find the domain, returns the message NXDOMAIN.

## ***Types of DNS Records***

***DNS records*** are created by DNS servers to provide important information about a domain or hostname, particularly its current IP address. <br> 
There are about 40 record types, over 10 common types of DNS records are : <br><br>
 
- ***A record***, the most common record, also known as ***Address Mapping record***, stores an IPv4 address associated with a domain name or sub-domain name, and indicates the domain name to an IP address. 
- ***AAAA record(IP Version 6 Address record )*** configures the hostname to a 128-bits IPv6 address. Earlier, 32-bits IPv4 addresses served the purpose of identifying a computer on the internet. But due to the shortage of IPv4, IPv6 was created. Interestingly, the four "A" s (AAAA) are mnemonic to represent that IPv6 is four times larger in size than IPv4. 
- ***CNAME record (Canonical Name record)*** creates an alias for one domain name. The aliased domain or subdomain derives all the original Domain's DNS records and is commonly used to associate subdomains with the existing main domain. So, when a DNS client requests a record that contains a CNAME, which points to another hostname, the DNS resolution process is repeated with the new hostname.
- ***MX record (Mail Exchange records)*** guides which mail exchange servers are responsible for routing the outgoing email to the correct destination or mail server.
- ***NS record ( Name Server records)*** refers to and provides the address of the name server which is authorized to manage and publish DNS records of that domain. These are the DNS servers that are authoritative to handle any query related to that domain.
- ***TXT or Text record*** allows the website's administrator to insert any arbitrary text in the DNS record, mainly carries data like DKIM, DMARC, sender policy framework and other readable data.
- ***SRV record (Service Location record)*** indicates which specific services the domain operates along with port numbers.It is like MX but is for some Internet protocols such as the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
- ***SOA record***, also known as ***Start of Authority records***, appears at the beginning of the DNS zone file, provides essential information about the domain like identifying the master node of the domain authoritative nameserver, an email of the domain administrator, the serial number of the DNS zone, etc.
- A ***PTR record or Reverse-lookup Pointer record***, points the IPv4 or IPv6 address to its machine's hostname. It provides a reverse DNS record, also known as rDNS record, by pointing an IP address to the server's hostname.
- The ***CAA record***, also known as ***Certification Authority Authorization*** record, reflects the public policy regarding the issuance of digital certificates for the domain. If no CAA record is present for our domain, any Certification Authority can issue an SSL certificate for our domain. However, by using this record, we can restrict which CA is authorized to issue digital credentials for your domain.
- ***DS record (Delegation Signer record)*** consists of the unique characters of our public key and its related metadata like Key Tag, Algorithm, Digest Type and cryptographic hash value called Digest.
- ***DNSKEY record or DNS Key record*** consists of public signing keys like Zone Signing Key (ZSK) and Key Signing Key (KSK). The DS and DNSKEY records serve to validate the authenticity of DNS records returned by the DNS Server.
- ***CERT Record or Certificate record*** stores encryption certificates—PKIX, SPKI, PGP, and so on.

 <br>
 
We are periodically able to modify our DNS settings to set up various tools and services. We do this by changing various types of ***DNS records***, meant for handling authorative instructions of our DNS servers, namely, *MX Record, TXT Record, NS Record* etc.
 
 
## ***DNS Lookup Tool:***
It is the DNS lookup tool that gathers all the DNS records, including A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, SRV, SOA, TXT, CAA, DS, DNSKEY, and many more, for a domain and reports them in a priority list. We can use DNS lookup tool to verify our DNS records or check whether we have configured the correct DNS records for our domain. 
 
## ***3 Types of DNS Queries***
There are three types of queries in the DNS system:
- ***Recursive Query*** 

In this type of query, the server fully answers the query. A DNS client provides a domain, and the DNS Resolver must provide an answer, it responds either with a relevant resource record, or an error message if the resource cannot be found. The resolver starts a recursive query process, initiating from the DNS Root Server, until it finds the Authoritative Name Server that holds the IP address and other information for the requested domain/hostname. <br>
 
- ***Iterative Query***

In an iterative query, a DNS client provides a hostname, and the DNS Resolver returns the best answer possible by itself or If the DNS resolver has the relevant DNS records in its cache, it returns them. Otherwise, it refers the DNS client to the Root Server, or another Authoritative Name Server which is nearest to the required DNS zone. The DNS client must then repeat the query directly against the DNS server it was referred to. 

- ***Non-Recursive Query***

A non-recursive query is a query in which the DNS Resolver already knows the answer. It either immediately returns a DNS record because it already stores it in a local cache, or generally queries and sends it back to a DNS Name Server which is authoritative for the record, meaning it definitely holds the correct IP for that hostname. In both cases, there is no need for additional rounds of queries (like in recursive or iterative queries). Rather, a response is immediately returned to the client.

## 🤔
We often confuse ***domain names*** with universal ***resource locators or URLs and Internet Protocol or IP addresses.*** Let's try it picture them clearly :<br>
 
## ***📌Uniform Resource Locator (URL)***
A URL is the web address of a resource on the Internet. This is the address you type in a browser to visit a particular web site. <br><br>
 
The domain name is one of the pieces inside a URL and most easily recognized part of the entire address. When computer users type a web address directly into the address box at the top of their browser window, it initiates a process of locating the page requested. To do so, the instructions contained inside the URL, including the domain name, must correctly point to that location. The IP address is a numerical code that makes this possible.
 
To summarize, the domain name is a part of the URL, which points to the associated IP address. <br><br>

***A popular analogy can be : “People find web pages in a manner similar to the way that they use maps to find physical locations. If the Internet is like a phone book, and a web page is like a physical building, the URL would be the precise street address of that building. The IP address would be like the car that travels to its destination.”***
