# CSS UNITS   
` Many CSS properties like width, margin, padding, font-size etc. take length. CSS has a way to express length in multiple units. Length is a combination of a number and unit with no whitespace. E.g. 5px, 0.7em. ` 
## TYPES OF UNITS
### 1. Absolute Units
` It is not good for use on-screen, cause screen size varies so much depending on the device used for that page it is recommended to use for print layout and where the output medium is known. `     
| Unit | Explanation |
| ---- | ----------- |
| cm | It is used to define the measurement in centimeters.|
| mm |	It is used to define the measurement in millimeters.|
| in | It is used to define the measurement in inches.|
| pt |	It is used to define the measurement in points. |
| pc |	It is used to define the measurement in picas. |
| px |	It is used to define the measurement in pixels. |

### 2. Relative Units  
` It is good for use on screen, if screen size varies so much depending on the device then these relative length units are perfect because it changes with the different rendering mediums. `
| unit | Explanation |
| ---- | ----------- |
| em | It is relative to the font-size of the element |
| ex | It is relative to the x-height of the font of the element. It is rarely used. The x-height is determined by the height of the lowercase letter 'x'. |
| ch | It is similar to the unit ex, but instead of using the height of the letter x, it measures the width of the integer "0" (zero). |
| rem | It is the font-size of the root element |
| vh | It is relative to the height of the viewport. 1vh = 1% or 1/100 of the height of the viewport. |
| vw | It is relative to the width of the viewport. 1vw = 1% or 1/100 of the width of viewport |
| vmin | It is relative to the smaller dimension of the viewport. 1vmin = 1% or 1/100 of the viewport's smaller dimension. |
| vmax | It is relative to the larger dimension of the viewport. 1vmax = 1% or 1/100 of the viewport's larger dimension. |
| % |	It is used to define the measurement as a percentage that is relative to another value. |
