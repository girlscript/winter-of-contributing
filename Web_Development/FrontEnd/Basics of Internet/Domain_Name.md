# Domain Name

## What is Domain Name?

Domain name is the address of your website that people type in the browser URL bar to visit your website.

In simple terms, if your website was a house, then your domain name will be its address.

>>> A more detailed explanation :

The Internet is a giant network of computers connected to each other through a global network of cables. Each computer on this network can communicate with other computers.

To identify them, each computer is assigned an IP address. It is a series of numbers that identify a particular computer on the internet. A typical IP address looks like this:

66.249.66.1

Now an IP address like this is quite difficult to remember. Imagine if you had to use such numbers to visit your favorite websites.

Domain names were invented to solve this problem.

Now if you want to visit a website, then you don’t need to enter a long string of numbers. Instead, you can visit it by typing an easy to remember domain name in your browser’s address bar. For example, leetcode.com.

## How does a Domain Name Work?

When you enter an address into your search bar. This will then send a request to the Domain Name System (DNS).

The DNS is a network of servers – or computers – that acts in the same way as a huge address book. It contains information on all the locations on the internet where your name could possibly be stored. These locations are called name servers, and they’re managed by your hosting company. If your domain name is like your house address, these are the towns where that house is based.

Once it has found the name servers that host your domain name, the DNS forward the request to them, letting them know that someone wants to view your website. Your hosting provider will then find the computer, or web server, where your website lives.

Think of the web server as your street. Once your hosting provider is on the right street, it’ll gather up all of the data collected under your domain name that makes up your website. It’ll then send it back to the browser.

We know it might sound like there are a lot of steps to get through just to display a website, but it all happens in the blink of an eye. Your visitors won’t be left waiting for more than a couple of seconds!
