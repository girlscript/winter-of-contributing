## How does a Domain Name work? 
Keep note that every domain is linked to an IP address. When anyone enters domain name into search engine (browser), then the server will search through a global server network that made the DNS (Domain Name System).
Then the Domain Name System (DNS) server will search for the IP address associated with the domain name. The server that have information about that IP address will return it to your browser. After that, it will request data about the site from the domain’s hosting server. After this process you get your website on your screen. 
It might like that this process take much time to do operations but it doesn't take much time to do operations. The result appears in the blink of an eye.
