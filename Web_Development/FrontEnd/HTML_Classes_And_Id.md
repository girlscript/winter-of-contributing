# HTML Class Attribute

The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element. Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.
## Syntax for class 
To create a class :
 * Method 1 :-  Write a period "." character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}:  (You can see in example 1) 
 * Method 2 :-  The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.    (You can see in example 2)
### Example 1 : 
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
		<head>
			<style>
			.city {
				  background-color: green;
				  color: white;
				  padding: 10px;
			}
			</style>
		</head>
		<body>

			<h2>The class Attribute</h2>

			<h2 class="city">New Delhi</h2>
			<p>New Delhi is the capital of India.</p>

			<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
			<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>

# HTML id attribute
The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element. You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.

The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
## Syntax for id
To create a id :
 write a hash character #, followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
### Example 1 :
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
		<head>
			<style>
				#city1 {
				  background-color: green;
				  color: white;
				  padding: 10px;
				}
				#city2 {
				  background-color: yellow;
				  color: black;
				  padding: 10px;
				}
				#city3 {
				  background-color: purple;
				  color: white;
				  padding: 10px;
				}
			</style>
		</head>
		<body>

			<h2>The id Attribute</h2>

			<style>
				h1#intro {
				color: blue;
				}
				p#important {
					color: green;
				}
			</style>
		</head>

## Main difference between Class & Id :
The only difference between Class and Id is that ID is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while Class selector can apply to multiple elements.
## Conclusion :
When youâ€™re working with CSS, there are no specific reasons forcing you to use an ID over a class. However, it is best practice to only use IDs if you want a style to apply to one element on the web page, and to use classes if you want a style to apply to multiple elements.
