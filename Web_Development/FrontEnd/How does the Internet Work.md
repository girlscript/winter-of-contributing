- **INTERNET** is a short form of Interconnected Network of all the Web Servers Worldwide. It is also called **the World Wide Web** or simply the Web.
- The Internet is **a vast network that connects computers all over the world**.

**Step1-** Your PC or device is connected to the web through a modem or router. Together, these devices allow you to connect to other networks around the globe.

- **Router-** Routers **connect computers and other devices to the Internet**. A router acts as a dispatcher, choosing the best route for your information to travel. It connects your business to the world, protects information from security threats, and can even decide which computers get priority over others.

As its name implies, it “routes” traffic between the devices and the internet.

- **Modem-** A modem is a **device that connects your home**, usually through a coax cable connection, to your Internet service provider (ISP). The modem takes signals from your ISP and translates them into signals your local devices can use, and vice versa.

**Step2-** ISPs are responsible **for making sure you can access the Internet, routing Internet traffic, resolving domain names, and maintaining the network infrastructure that makes Internet access possible**. 

**Step3-** Fundamentally, a data center connects to the internet like any other user: **through a dedicated service provider's line**. Unlike a typical building, however, data centers have multiple connections available from different providers, allowing them to offer a range of options to their customers.

**Step4-** A server is **a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to another computer over the internet or a local network**. A well-known type of server is a web server where web pages can be accessed over the internet through a client like a web browser.

**Note-** 

- When data is transferred over the internet, it’s delivered in messages and packets. 
- Data sent over the internet is called a message, but before messages get sent, they’re broken up into tinier parts called packets.
- These messages and packets travel from one source to the next using Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP).
- **Internet Protocol** (**IP**) is the method or protocol by which data is sent from one computer to another on the internet.
- IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers.
- The **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** is a transport protocol that is used on top of IP to ensure reliable transmission of packets.
