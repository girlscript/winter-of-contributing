## Basics of Domain name

### Simple explanation of domain name:

Domain name refers to a string of characters which is used to navigate to a certain webpage. It acts like an identity to a web page. E.g. to refer to a person standing away, we call them by a sequence of characters called their "name". This name in terms of website is called as domain name.

This domain name is actually a string representation of the IP address of a website from where the contents of web site can be requested and received. 

Let us say that a website is located at IP address 192.168.a.b (a and b are used to not refer to a particular website). What would happen if we were to memorize this IP address and recall it everytime we needed to visit a webpage? It is possible to remember a set of 4 numbers in sequence to visit a webpage. But now, the problem arises. We visit a lot of webpages every single day. To visit all these web pages, we have to remember their ip addresses all of them. This would create a lot of confusion and is not feasible. Hence, to make it simpler, a string of characters is mapped with each IP address and that string of characters is easy to remember since they mostly resemble the brand name which we are trying to visit. This string of characters is what called as the domain name of the particular website.

### Identification of domain name from a website url:
Let us identify the various components of a website URL(Uniform Resourse Locator) to gain idea about the domain name. A URL contains following parts:

- scheme: the protocols like http (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) or https (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)
- subdomain: E.g. www
- second level domain: E.g. girlscript, google, wikipedia
- top level domain: E.g. com, gov, tech, in
- subdirectory: E.g. /gwoc, /posts
- queue string: E.g. search?q=domain+name
The subdomain, second level domain and top level domain together form the domain of a website url.

### An example of domain name:

Website URL of GirlScript: https://www.girlscript.tech/home

Here, https is a scheme, www is a subdomain, girlscript is a second level domain and tech is top level domain. Also note that /home is a subdirectory and there is no queue string in this URL.
Hence, the domain name of this website is www.girlscript.tech which can be used to visit the official website of GirlScript.
