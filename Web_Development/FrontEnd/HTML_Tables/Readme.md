# HTML TABLES
Tables are used to show the tabular data. To achieve this many tags are used. All the table- data is enclosed within the ```<table>``` tags.
<br>

A table is divided into rows (with the ```<tr>``` tag), and each row is divided into data cells (with the ```<td>``` tag). **tr** stands for table row, which represents the row of a table and td stands fortable-data, which is the content of a data cell. 
<br>

A data cell can contain text, images, lists, paragraphs, forms, horizontal rules, 
<br>
Eg:
```
<table border=1>
<tr>
    <td>Row 1, cell 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, cell 2</td>
    <td>Row 1, cell 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Row 2, cell 1</td>
    <td>Row 2, cell 2</td>
    <td>Row 2, cell 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Row 3, cell 1</td>
    <td>Row 3, cell 2</td>
    <td>Row 3, cell 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Row 4, cell 1</td>
    <td>Row 4, cell 2</td>
    <td>Row 4, cell 3</td>
</tr>
</table>
```
