 ## How does it work?
 #### In order to understand this let's take the example of the Google Search Engine.
 - Google stores all its web pages in an ***index***. Every ***index*** entry has a Description and URL assiciated with it. *To index* is when Google fetches a page, reads it, and adds it to the index: *Google indexed several pages on my site today*.
 - Google *crawls* the web, looking for new pages, then indexes them if necessary with the help of its *crawler*- the *GoogleBot*. GoogleBot is an automated software that acts as a librarian to help us find what we are searching for.<br>
