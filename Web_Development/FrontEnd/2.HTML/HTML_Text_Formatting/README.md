# HTML Text Formatting

HTML Text Formatting is formatting the text in different styles. HTML provides us many predefined tags that can be used to format texts without using CSS. These tags help us to highlight the texts, to make it bold, italic, subscript, superscript, underlined and many more. Some tags are only for visual appearance while some adds semantic value to the text.
