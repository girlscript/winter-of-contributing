1. Selection Sort : 

Approach:
Keep two separate parts:-sorted and unsorted. 
So at the beginning we will keep inserting the sorted part. 
So to achieve this we have to first find the minimum element in the whole array and put it at the first index.
 So now the beginning part is sorted. 
Now find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array and 
place it at the next index after the sorted part. Keep doing the same until whole array is sorted. 
When only one element is left in the unsorted part means the whole array is sorted.  

Time Complexity: O(N^2) 
Space complexity: O(1).
