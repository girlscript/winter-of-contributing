Bubble Sort : 

Approach: Keep two separate parts, unsorted at the beginning and sorted at the end of the array. 
For n-1 iterations, swap elements from the beginning if arr[i]>arr[i+1] 
so that the maximum element in the unsorted part is placed at the first position of the sorted part of the array. 
For every itr th iteration run a loop from from 0th index to n-itr-1 th iteration. 
After n-1 iterations the array will be sorted. 

Time complexity: O(N^2) for worst case & O(N) for best case. 
Space Complexity: O(1)
InPlace Algorithm: Yes
Stable algorithm: Yes
