Insertion sort :

Approach:
Keep sorted part at the beginning and the unsorted part at the end. 
Keep the first element of the unsorted part at the right position in the sorted part so that the sorted part remains sorted. 
Keep this for element with index 1 to n-1. 

Time complexity: O(N^2) for worst case & O(N) for best case. 
Space Complexity: O(1)
Inplace algorithm: YES
Stable algorithm: YES
