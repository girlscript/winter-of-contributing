- Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics, but the truth of it is that linear algebra is the mathematics of data. Matrices and vectors are the language of data.

- Linear algebra is about linear combinations. That is, using arithmetic on columns of numbers called vectors and arrays of numbers called matrices, to create new columns and arrays of numbers. Linear algebra is the study of lines and planes, vector spaces and mappings that are required for linear transforms.

## Linear Algebra and Statistics

- It is used in multivariate statistics with the help of vectors and matrices.
- It is a path for analysis of regression algorithms like linear regression, polynomial regression, and logistic regression.
- It helps in the calculation of least squares and weighted least squares
- Mean and median calculations
- Principal component analysis for data reduction draws many of these elements together.

## Applications of Linear Algebra

As linear algebra is the mathematics of data, the tools of linear algebra are used in many domains.

- Matrices in Engineering, such as a line of springs.
- Graphs and Networks, such as analyzing networks.
- Markov Matrices, Population, and Economics, such as population growth.
- Linear Programming, the simplex optimization method.
- Fourier Series: Linear Algebra for functions, used widely in signal processing.
- Linear Algebra for statistics and probability, such as least squares for regression.
- Computer Graphics, such as the various translation, rescaling and rotation of images.


Another interesting application of linear algebra is that it is the type of mathematics used by Albert Einstein in parts of his theory of relativity. Specifically tensors and tensor calculus. He also introduced a new type of linear algebra notation to physics called Einstein notation, or the Einstein summation convention.

## Benefits:

- It helps in understanding the theory behind the modes in ml and gives better intutition.
- It helps in better decision making , data preprocessing , data transformation.


## **Conclusion:**
- Linear algebra lays a path for building blocks of mathematical operations behind machine learning models. It helps in knowing better on how the models work. It helps in reducing the burden on oneâ€™ while dealing with models.
