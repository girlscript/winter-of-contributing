<h1 align="left">Getting started with Linear Algebra</h1>

## Aim:
To give a brief introduction on what is Linear Algebra, some of its important topics ,basic examples and code snipets for simple calculation using numpy library.

## What is Linear Algebra?
<h3>A branch of mathematics dealing with linear equations.</h3>
</br>

***Some important topics of Linear Algebra in relation to Data Science:*** 
> **1. VECTORS AND PROPERTIES** 

          1.1 ADDITION
          1.2 DOT PRODUCT
          1.3 MAGNITUDE OF A VECTOR
          1.4 ORTHOGONAL AND ORTHONORMAL VECTORS
>**2. MATRICES AND PROPERTIES**

          2.1 MULTIPLICATION
          2.2 DIAGONAL MATRIX
          2.3 IDENTITY MATRIX
          2.4 TRANSPOSE MATRIX
          2.5 INVERSE OF A MATRIX
>**3. EIGEN VECTORS AND VALUES**

## Applications:
   1. Plays a major role in managing and simplifing the huge datasets required for datascience.
   2. Linear regression can be easily found with the help of Linear algebra.
   3. Natural Language Processing also requires Linear algebra for managing the hugwe amount of words.
   4. Linear Algebra has a importance in Computer Vision for image processing techniques.

## Python Library used for implementation:
   >***NUMPY***
   
## Conclusion:
**Linear Algebra is an integral part of datascience. It helps in simplifing and understanding a dataset
     which contains thousands of rows and columns. A basic knowledge in maths and algebra can help an individual to master Linear Algebra quickly.**
