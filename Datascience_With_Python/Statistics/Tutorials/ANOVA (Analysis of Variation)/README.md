## ANOVA
- Full form is ***â€˜Analysis of Variance.'***
- It is an ***analysis tool used in statistics.***
- It splits an observed variability of a data set into two parts: 
      - ***systematic factors and random factors.***
- Analysts use the ANOVA test to determine the influence that independent variables have on the dependent variable in a regression study.
- It is the extension of the t- and z-tests.

## What Does the Analysis of Variance Reveal?
- The ANOVA test is the initial step in analyzing factors that affect a given data set.The ANOVA test allows a comparison of more than two groups at the same time to determine whether a relationship exists between them. The result of the ANOVA formula, the F statistic (also called the F-ratio), allows for the analysis of multiple groups of data to determine the variability between samples and within samples.If no real difference exists between the tested groups, which is called the null hypothesis, the result of the ANOVA's F-ratio statistic will be close to 1. 

## There are two main types of ANOVA: 
- *one-way (or unidirectional)*
- *Two-way*

1.	A one-way ANOVA is primarily designed to enable the equality testing between three or more means. A two-way ANOVA is designed to assess the interrelationship of two independent variables on a dependent variable. 

2.	A one-way ANOVA only involves one factor or independent variable, whereas there are two independent variables in a two-way ANOVA.

3.	In a one-way ANOVA, the one factor or independent variable analyzed has three or more categorical groups. A two-way ANOVA instead compares multiple groups of two factors. 

4.	One-way ANOVA need to satisfy only two principles of design of experiments, i.e. replication and randomization. As opposed to Two-way ANOVA, which meets all three principles of design of experiments which are replication, randomization, and local control.

## Uses of ANOVA
- To test correlation and regression.
- To study the homogeneity in the case of two-way classification.
- To test the significance of the multiple correlation coefficient.
- To test the linearity of regression.
## Advantages
- Suitable for multidimensional variables.
- Analysis of various factors at a time.
- Can be used in 3 or more than 3 groups
## Disadvantages
- It is difficult to analyze ANOVA under strict assumptions regarding the nature of data.
- It is not so helpful in comparison with the t-test that there is no special interpretation of the significance of two means.
- The requirement of the post-ANOVA t-test for further testing.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS
- Analysis of variance, or ANOVA, is a statistical method that separates observed variance data into different components to use for additional tests.
- A one-way ANOVA is used for three or more groups of data, to gain information about the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
- If no true variance exists between the groups, the ANOVA's F-ratio should equal close to 1.
