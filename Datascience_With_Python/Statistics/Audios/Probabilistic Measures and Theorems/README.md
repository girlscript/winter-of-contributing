- Probability is the measure of uncertainty of any event (any phenomenon happened or bound to happen).
-  Before we dive into the world of understanding the concept of Probability through the various formulas involved to calculate it, we need to understand few crucial terms or make ourselves familiar with the terminology associated with the Probability.

**Terms to know:**
-  Experiment: Any phenomenon like rolling a dice, tossing a coin, drawing a card from a well-shuffled deck, etc.
-  Outcome: The Result of any event; like number appearing on a dice, side of a coin, drawn out card, etc.
-  Sample Space: The set of all possible outcomes.
-  Event: Any combination of possible outcomes or the subset of sample space; like getting an even number on rolled dice, getting a head/tail on a flipped coin, drawing out a king/queen/ace of any suit.
-  Probability Function: A function giving the probability for each outcome.

**Features:**
- The probability ranges from 0 to 1. 1: a certain result; 0: impossibility; and various in-between values measure the uncertainty.
- P[sum of all possible events]=1.
- P[sum of events]= Sum of probabilities of events.

**Theorems of Probability:**
-  The probability of the complementary event A’ of A is given by P(A’) = 1 – P(A).
-  The probability of the impossible event is zero.
-  If A and B are any two events and are not disjoint, then P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A ∩ B). A and B are the subsets of sample space S.

- Bayes Theorem:
      - We are quite familiar with probability and its calculation. From one known probability we can go on calculating others. 
      - But can we use all the prior information to calculate or to measure the chance of some events happened in past? This is the posterior probability. 
      - Bayes theorem calculates the posterior probability of a new event using a prior probability of some events.

**Advantages:** 
- The absence of systematic error and sampling bias.
- Higher level of reliability of research findings.
- Increased accuracy of sampling error estimation.
- The possibility to make inferences about the population.

**Overview:**
- Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true.
- The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty.
