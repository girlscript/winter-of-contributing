**Statistics:**
- It is important as it helps in knowing the dataset better other than knowing only the data values.
- It helps in discovering new meaningful insights.
- Statistics in Data Preparation
       - It helps in detecting Outlier detection, Missing value imputation, Data sampling, Data scaling, Variable encoding.
       - Detecting outliers, missing values, knowing the data types helps in making the dataset easier for the model by reducing the complexity within ones’ own dataset.
- Statistics in Model Evaluation
       - It helps in model evaluation like Data sampling, Data resampling, Experimental design.

**Probability:**
- Classification models must predict a probability of class membership.
- Algorithms are designed using probability (e.g. Naive Bayes).
- Learning algorithms will make decisions using probability (e.g. information gain).
- Sub-fields of study are built on probability (e.g. Bayesian networks).
- Algorithms are trained under probability frameworks (e.g. maximum likelihood).
- Models are fit using probabilistic loss functions (e.g. log loss and cross-entropy).
- Model hyperparameters are configured with probability (e.g. Bayesian optimization).
- Probabilistic measures are used to evaluate model skill (e.g. brier score, ROC).

**Inference**
- Machine learning (ML) inference is the process of running live data points into a machine learning algorithm (or “ML model”) to calculate an output such as a single numerical score. 
- This process is also referred to as “operationalizing an ML model” or “putting an ML model into production.” When an ML model is running in production, it is often then described as artificial intelligence (AI) since it is performing functions similar to human thinking and analysis.

**Benefits:**
- For easy predictions
- Reduces the complexity
- Makes the dataset ease than before

**Conclusion:**
- Statistics have the advantage of finding out meaningful insights. Probability is used in many models and making the best predictions. The inference is the process of running live data points into a machine-learning algorithm to calculate an output such as a single numerical score. All three helps and reduce the work and complexity of the dataset.
