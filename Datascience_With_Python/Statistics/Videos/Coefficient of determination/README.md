- The coefficient of determination is R^2 or r-squared.
- It is the statistical measure in a regression model.
- It helps in determining the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable.
- It tells how well the data fits the model in other words, it tells the goodness of fit.

**How the coefficient of determination helps in conveying the goodness of fit of the model?**
- The coefficient of determination tells how well the regression model fits the observed data. 
- For example, a coefficient of determination of 80% shows that 80% of the data fit the regression model. 
- Usually, when the model has an r-squared value is greater than 85% is considered a good fit. 
- When the model has an r-squared value in the range of 85% -  60% is considered a moderate fit for the model. 
- When the model has an r-squared value is less than 60% is considered not a  good fit for the model.

**Calculation of the Coefficient:**
Mathematically, the coefficient of determination can be found using the following formula:

Where:

SSregression – The sum of squares due to regression (explained sum of squares)

SStotal –  The total sum of squaresk

- The coefficient of determination, R2, is similar to the correlation coefficient, R. 
- The correlation coefficient formula will tell you how strong of a linear relationship there is between two variables. 
- R Squared is the square of the correlation coefficient, r (hence the term r squared).
- The coefficient of determination shows only association. 
- As with linear regression, it is impossible to use R2 to determine whether one variable causes the other. 
- In addition, the coefficient of determination shows only the magnitude of the association, not whether that association is statistically significant.

**Conclusion:**
- The coefficient of determination is a statistical analysis of models for data.
- The coefficient of determination is used to explain how much variability of one factor can be caused by its relationship to another factor.
- This coefficient of determination is commonly known as R-squared or R2 and is sometimes referred to as the goodness of fit.
