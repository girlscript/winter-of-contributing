- A Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.
- A countably infinite sequence, in which the chain moves state at discrete time steps, gives a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). 
- A continuous-time process is called a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). It is named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov.
- Markov chains have many applications as statistical models of real-world processes,such as studying cruise control systems in motor vehicles, queues or lines of customers arriving at an airport, currency exchange rates and animal population dynamics.
- Markov processes are the basis for general stochastic simulation methods known as Markov chain Monte Carlo, which are used for simulating sampling from complex probability distributions, and have found application in Bayesian statistics, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, physics, chemistry, economics, finance, signal processing, information theory and speech processing

**Types of Markov chains:**
- The system's state space and time parameter index need to be specified. 
- The following table gives an overview of the different instances of Markov processes for different levels of state space generality and for discrete time v. continuous time:

**What is a Markov chain used for?**
- Markov chains are an important concept in stochastic processes. 
- They can be used to greatly simplify processes that satisfy the Markov property, namely that the future state of a stochastic variable is only dependent on its present state.

**Advantages and Disadvantages** 

The primary benefits of Markov analysis are simplicity and out-of-sample forecasting accuracy. Simple models, such as those used for Markov analysis, are often better at making predictions than more complicated models. This result is well-known in econometrics.
Unfortunately, Markov analysis is not very useful for explaining events, and it cannot be the true model of the underlying situation in most cases. Yes, it is relatively easy to estimate conditional probabilities based on the current state. However, that often tells one little about why something happened.

**Overview:**
- Markov analysis is a method used to forecast the value of a variable whose predicted value is influenced only by its current state.
- The primary advantages of Markov analysis are simplicity and out-of-sample forecasting accuracy.
- Markov analysis is not very useful for explaining events, and it cannot be the true model of the underlying situation in most cases.
- Markov analysis is useful for financial speculators, especially momentum investors.
