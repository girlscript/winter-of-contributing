# **Data Pre Processing**

## **Introduction**

While working on a Machine Learning & Data Science project, the first step is to preprocess the data because we might come across an unbalanced data i.e. have null data values or  missing data values or any inappropriate data values etc. 
- So, it becomes important to balance the data before moving to Data Creation & Model creation steps.
-This tutorial will help understand how to preprcess data and improve performance of the project.

## **Purpose**

The main prupose is to give a clear understanding on data pre processing data, how it's done, usage, libaries used etc.

## **Brief Explanation**

This tutorial will help understand how to pre process data and improve performance of the project.
