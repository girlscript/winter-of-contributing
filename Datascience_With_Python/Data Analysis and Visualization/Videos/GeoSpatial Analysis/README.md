## Geospatial Analytics Definition

- Geospatial analytics gathers, manipulates and displays geographic information system (GIS) data and imagery including GPS and satellite photographs. Geospatial data analytics rely on geographic coordinates and specific identifiers such as street address and zip code.
-  They are used to create geographic models and data visualizations for more accurate modeling and predictions of trends.

## What is Geospatial Analytics?
- Geospatial analytics uses data from all kinds of technology — GPS, location sensors, social media, mobile devices, satellite imagery — to build data visualizations for understanding phenomena and finding trends in complex relationships between people and places. This geo-referenced data can be applied to nearly any happening on earth. The visualizations can include maps, graphs, statistics and cartograms that show historical changes and current shifts. This can make predictions easier and more accurate.

- Geospatial analytics adds timing and location to traditional types of data and this additional context allows for a more complete picture of events. Insights that might have been lost in a massive spreadsheet are revealed in easy-to-recognize visual patterns and images.

- Geospatial analytics companies are able to instantly process huge amounts of geographic and geometric data. This gives users the ability to interact with billions of mapped points while looking at real-time geospatial visualizations. Users can explore data across time and space to instantly see how something has changed from days to years.

## Benefits of Using Geospatial Data in Analytics

- Engaging insights — Seeing data in the context of a visual map makes it easier to understand how events are unfolding and how to react to those events.
- Better foresight — Seeing how spatial conditions are changing in real time can help an organization better prepare for change and determine future action.
- Targeted solutions — Seeing location-based data helps organizations understand why some locations and countries, such as the United States, are more successful for business than others.

## Five markets in geospatial imagery analytics:

- Imaging — segmented into video and image.
- Technology — segmented into GPS, GIS analysis, remote sensing (RS) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS).
- Analysis — segmented into surface analysis, network analysis and geovisualization.
- Application — segmented into agriculture, defense/security, energy, engineering/construction, environment-monitoring, government data analytics, healthcare, insurance, mining/manufacturing, natural resources.
- Geography — segmented into Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and Rest of the World (RoW). RoW includes Africa, Middle East and South America.
