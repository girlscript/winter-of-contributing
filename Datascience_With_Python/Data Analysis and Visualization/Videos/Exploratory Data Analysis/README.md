Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

EDA is an iterative cycle. You:
- Generate questions about your data.
- Search for answers by visualising, transforming, and modelling your data.
- Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions.

## What is Pandas?
Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

- Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
- Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
- Relevant data is very important in data science.

## Installation and Importing Pandas
To install pandas
```
pip install pandas
```
To Import pandas
```
import pandas as pd
```

## Application of Pandas
Data is found everywhere in today's world. Extracting usable information from data is now a complex process, and the world is investing a lot of time and money to do so. Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. Pandas is used in Statistics, Analytics, Big Data, Neuroscience, etc.

## Dataset Used
The dataset is about the sales and profit of a business in US. It contains information about the sales across multiple categories and sub-categories divided by regions.

## Other Libraries For Data Analysis in Python
**SweetViz**: It is an open-source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) process with just two lines of code. The output is a self-contained HTML application.

**Pandas Profiling**: Pandas profiling is yet another EDA platform more often than not, the first one learners learn. It is as well the most popular too. Indeed, Pandas Profiling is relatively easy to use, to set up, and feels like an extension to your standard pandas library rather than a system of its own. It is easily integrable with your favorite tools(Jypyter & Collab), and there is extensive documentation on how to use the library. Additionally, there is a good community around this library that is ready to answer any questions you may have. 

**Dataprep**: Dataprep is one of the fastest EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) tools in Python. It allows you to understand a Pandas/Dask DataFrame with a few lines of code in seconds. Indeed, Dataprep allows the user to explore features/characteristics of a dataset through simple APIs. The awesome part about it is that you can go through a dataset from a high level to a low level, allowing you to test different perspectives.



## Conclusion
Lastly, to sum up all Exploratory Data Analysis is a philosophical and an artistical approach to guage every nuance from the data at early encounter.
Let the data speak to you. There is no one-size-fits-all methodology and tools that are suitable for all EDA. It varies from project to project, and it is up to you to figure out what tools allow you to go through the EDA process comfortably.
