##  Dealing with missing values
## [Click here to see the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SaUwt8zWtJiIQRx_Q2V0sUWOBCU_Af6P/view?usp=sharing)

- The dataset which has no outliers, no missing values are rarely available. If the dataset 
has outliers, missing values, they need to be treated.
- Causes of missing values:
            -Improper in data entry.
            - Non-availability of data.

- Following ate the ways of handle missing values in the dataset:

            - Deleting the rows which has missing values-
            - Impute missing values-
            - Other Imputation Methods-
            - Using Algorithms that support missing values-
            - Prediction of missing values
            - Imputation using Deep Learning Library â€” Datawig

- Deleting the rows which has missing values has the disadvantage and the disadvantage is we might tend to 
miss the data which might be important or which might play a vital role in the model.
- Impute missing values:
- There are three imputation ways on broadly:
     - Mean imputation.
     - Median imputation.
     - Mode imputation.
- Mean imputation and median imputation are used for numerical values are present in dataset.
- Mode imputation is used when categorical values are present in dataset.
- Mean imputation has the disadvantage when outliers are present in dataset. So, when data has the outliers 
also missing values then median imputation is used.
- Mode imputation is used when missing values are categorical 

Disadvantage of having missing values:
It reduces statistical power.
It can cause bias in the estimation of parameters.
It can reduce the representativeness of the samples.

Advantage of treating missing values:
Model can perform with accurate results.
Reduces the computational burden or complexity within the dataset.
