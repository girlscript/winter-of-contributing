# BOKEH-Interactive Data Visualization Python Library

Issue #8043

In this readme file,we will get familiar with **BOKEH-An Interactive Data Visualization Library in Python**.
All the basic concepts and terminologies will be explained and a brief walkthrough will also be given.
At the last,all the important resources for further references will also be provided.

The readme file consists of the following sections:
* Introduction
* Installation
* Benefits of Bokeh
* Visualizations with BOKEH
* Python Bokeh Examples
* Stepwise walkthrough
* Resources

# Introduction
BOKEH is an Introduction Python Data Visualization library which targets modern web browsers for presentation.
It assists us to build beautiful graphics;ranging from basic plots to complex dashboards with streaming datasets.

* BOKEH can produce elegant and interactive visualizations with high performance interactivity over very large streaming datasets.

With the help of this library,anyone can create interactive plots,dashboards and data applications. 

* Unlike other visualization libraries;Bokeh renders it graphics using static HTML pages.This is one of the key differences between BOKEH and other libraries.

Therefore making Bokeh a great library for building web-based dashboards and applications.

# Installation

*Before beginning with Bokeh,we need to have numpy library installed on our machine.*

**Installation with conda**

Use this command to install Bokeh:

```conda install bokeh```

**Installation with pip**

Use this command to install Bokeh:

 ```pip install bokeh```

## Benefits of Bokeh

* Bokeh provides us with the flexibility for applying interaction,layouts and different styling options to visualization.
* It allows us to build complex statistical plots quickly and through simple commands.
* With the help of Bokeh,our visualizations can be rendered in various mediums like HTML,Notebook or server.
* Bokeh can transform visualizations written in other libraries like matplotlib,seaborn,ggplot.

*However,one of main challenges to Bokeh is that it is one of the upcoming libraries; and therefore undergoing a lot of development and changes.Therefore,the code we write today may not be entirely reusable in the future.*

# Visualizations with BOKEH

Bokeh offers both powerful and flexible features which imparts simplicity and highly advanced customization.

Bokeh provides multiple visualization interfaces which are as follows:
- Charts
- Plotting
- Models

## Charts 
 Charts are a *high-level interface* used to represent in standard visualization form.

 These forms include box plot,bar chart,area plot,heatmap,donut chart etc.These plots can be generated by passing data frames,numpy arrays and dictionaries.

**Common methodology to create a chart:**
- Import the library and functions/methods.
- Prepare the data.
- Set the output mode.(Notebook,Web Browser or server)
- Create chart with styling option.
- Visualize the chart.

## Plotting
Plotting is an *intermediate-level* interface that is centered around composing visual glyphs.

We can create a visualization by combining various visual elements like dot,circles,line,patch etc. and tools like hover,zoom,save,reset,etc.

Bokeh plots can be created using ```bokeh.plotting``` interface which comes with a default set of tools and visual styles.
The steps for plotting are as follows:

- Import library,methods or functions.
- Select the output mode(notebook,web browser,server)
- Activate the figure (similar like matplotlib)
- Perform subsequent plotting operations,it will affect the generated figure.
- Visualize it.

# Python Bokeh Examples

**a)** Plotting a simple line graph.

**b)** Multiple plots

**c)** Vectorized Colors and Sizes

**d)** Linked Panning and Brushing

**e)** Datetime axes

# Stepwise Instructions

**I. Prepare the data:**

In this step we import data handling libraries like Pandas and Numpy.

This step is all about taking required steps to transform it into a form that is best-suited for intended visualization.

**II.Determine where the visualization will be rendered:**

In this step,we will determine where we want to view our visualization.

Bokeh provides two options to view our visualization; Static HTML file or inline visualization in Jupyter Notebook.

**III.Setting up the figures:**

We assemble our figure,preparing the canvas for our visualization.
Here,we can customize everything from titles to tick marks.

We can also setup a bunch of tools that enable various user interactions.

**IV.Connect to draw your data:**

In this step, we use Bokeh's multiple renderers to shape our data.We can draw our data from scratch in Bokeh using available marker and shape options,which are customizable.

Bokeh has some inbuilt functionality for building things like stacked bar charts etc.

**V.Organizing the layout:**

Along with standard grid-like layout options,Bokeh allows us to easily organize our visualizations into tabbed layout with just a few lines of code.

The plots can be quickly linked together,so a selection on one will be reflected on any combination of others.

**VI.Preview and Save our Data Creation:**

We'll able to explore our visualizations,examine our customization and play with any interaction if we are viewing our visualizations in HTML static page or Jupyter Notebook.
