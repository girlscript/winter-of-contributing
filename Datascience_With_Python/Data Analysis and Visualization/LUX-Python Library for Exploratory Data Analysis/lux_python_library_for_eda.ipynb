This may eventually result into shift of focus from establishment of critical realtionships within the data to the mechanics of visualization.\n",

    "The three major obstacles faced by data analysts are as follows:\n",
    "* *Plotting requires a considerable amount of code and prior decisions:*\n",
    "  In order to visualize the data,a user needs to make sure that the visualizations are upto the mark. Users need to think about how the visualizations should look like with all the specifications. Then we need to translate all these specification details into code.\n",
    "* *The disconnect between code and interactive tools:*\n",
    "   Most of the programming tools are inaccesible to beginners although they provide flexibility. Whereas the tools which are easy to use for beginners are not flexible and are hard to customize.\n",
    "* *Trial and Error procedure is tedious and overwhelming:*\n",
    "  A user has to try multiple visualizations before settling/choosing a final one. Every EDA requires continuous cycle of trial and error. This might lead to data analysts missing out on important insights which are present in their datasets. It is also possible that the user might not know what set of operations they should perform on their data set. This may lead to analysts losing track of the analysis.\n",
