**Scikit-learn:**
- Scikit-learn is an open source Python library that has powerful tools for data analysis and data mining. 
- It's available under the BSD license and is built on the following machine learning libraries:
                - NumPy
                - SciPy
                - Matplotlib

- The above pictures shows how sklearn provides the services for usage of models.

- Scikit-learn can only be useful to you when you know the basics of what to use it for. 
- A tabular dataset is what essentially is used for the data representation in this package. I
- f you’re trying to design a supervised learning problem then this tabular dataset will have to contain both the x and y variables. 
- However, if you’re trying to design an unsupervised learning problem then you need to provide only the x variables within the tabular dataset. 
- The reason for this is that x variables are considered to be independent variables at a higher level. 
- Meanwhile, the y variable is considered to be the dependent variable. 
- Both x and y variables can be either qualitative or quantitative descriptions of samples of interest. 
- Y variables are generally the target that predictive models are built to create
