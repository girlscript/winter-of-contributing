- The many applications of geospatial analysis include crisis management, climate change modeling, weather monitoring, sales analysis, human population forecasting and animal population management.
- Geospatial analyst filter out relevant from irrelevant data and apply it to conceptualize and visualize the order hidden within the apparent disorder of geographically sorted data.  
- Doing so allows them to provide accurate trend analysis, modeling and predictions. 
- However, analysts must remain vigilant to try to avoid spatial fallacies, biases or misunderstanding effects and causal relationships: 
     - Geospatial analysis is sometimes considered to encompass as much intuition as it does science.

**Use Cases:**
- Telecommunications 
      - Quickly visualize call detail records and network logs so network operations centers can fix issues before customers notice. Since network signal strength fluctuates by location over time, geospatial analytics helps telecommunications companies understand where anomalies occur and then resolve them.‍
- Military 
      - Logistics for military operations that provide a true view of situational awareness. Geospatial predictive analytics helps the military optimize placement of resources while using predictive analytics to assess infrastructure, anticipate maintenance needs and meet deadlines.‍
- Weather 
      - Rapid response to extreme weather by visualizing blizzards, wildfires and hurricanes fast enough for effective evacuation alerts. Geospatial data analytics also helps airlines with routing and gives insurance companies a better way to assess property risk.‍
- Urban Planning/Development 
      - Determine how growing populations affect energy, transportation and housing resources. Geospatial big data analytics helps planners visualize large datasets at the speed and scale. It also allows for compiling and cross-filtering data from many sources to see how crime, public health, education and housing/real estate outcomes vary by location.‍
- Natural Resource Exploration 
      - Improve efficiencies in exploration and field operations for oil and gas industries. Geospatial analytics helps inform every phase of upstream exploration and production from mapping to drilling. Geologists and project managers can use the visualized data to make decisions that reduce costs, minimize risks and improve output.

**Overview:**
- Geospatial analytics adds timing and location to traditional types of data and this additional context allows for a more complete picture of events. 
- Insights that might have been lost in a massive spreadsheet are revealed in easy-to-recognize visual patterns and images.
- Geospatial analytics companies are able to instantly process huge amounts of geographic and geometric data. 
- This gives users the ability to interact with billions of mapped points while looking at real-time geospatial visualizations. 
- Users can explore data across time and space to instantly see how something has changed from days to years.
