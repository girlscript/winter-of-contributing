## Seaborn: statistical data visualization

- Seaborn helps to visualize the statistical relationships, To understand how variables in a dataset are related to one another and how that relationship is dependent on other variables, we perform statistical analysis. 
- This Statistical analysis helps to visualize the trends and identify various patterns in the dataset.

**These are the plot will help to visualize:**

- Line Plot
- Scatter Plot
- Box plot
- Point plot
- Count plot
- Violin plot
- Swarm plot
- Bar plot
- KDE Plot

## Line plot


Lineplot Is the most popular plot to draw a relationship between x and y with the possibility of several semantic groupings.

## Scatter Plot:

Scatterplot Can be used with several semantic groupings which can help to understand well in a graph against continuous/categorical data. It can draw a two-dimensional graph.

## Box plot:
 

A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) s is the visual representation of the depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles against continuous/categorical data.

 

**A box plot consists of 5 things.**

 

- Minimum
- First Quartile or 25%
- Median (Second Quartile) or 50%
- Third Quartile or 75%
- Maximum

## Voilin Plot:

A voilin plot is similar to a boxplot. It shows several quantitative data across one or more categorical variables such that those distributions can be compared.

## Point plot:

Point plot used to show point estimates and confidence intervals using scatter plot glyphs. A point plot represents an estimate of central tendency for a numeric variable by the position of scatter plot points and provides some indication of the uncertainty around that estimate using error bars.

## Count plot:
Count plot used to Show the counts of observations in each categorical bin using bars.

## Advantages

We have some advantages of using seaborn in our application which is as follows;

- By using the seaborn library, we can easily represent our data on a plot.

- This library is used to visualize our data; we do not need to take care of the internal details; we just have to pass our data set or data inside the relplot() function, and it will calculate and place the value accordingly.

- Inside this, we can switch to any other representation of data using the ‘kind’ property inside it.
- It creates an interactive and informative plot to representation our data; also, this is easy for the user to understand and visualize the records on the application.
- It uses static aggregation for plot generation in python.
- As it is based on the matplotlib so while installing seaborn, we also have other libraries installed, out of which we have matplotlib, which also provides several features and functions to create more interactive plots in python.

## Disadvantages

Some of the disadvantages are:

- There are no such disadvantages of using the seaborn library; one thing that we have to do is its installation because it is not in built in python. we require to install this before use by using some commands. Apart from this, it does not have any disadvantages, it is also not a disadvantage, but a step added to use this while programming.

## Usage of Seaborn

Usage of seaborn are given below:

- Data visualization
- Use to show data as a line plot.
- Use to create high level informative and attractive plots to show the data.

## Conclusion

- By we have already discussed that it is basically used for data visualization because, in our application, we have a large amount of data that needs to be represented to the user in some readable and undertakable format, so seaborn helps the user to visualize data in the form of graphics. which makes it attractive and efficient.
