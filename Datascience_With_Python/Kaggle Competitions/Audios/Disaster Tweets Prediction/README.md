## Introduction:
- Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
- The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. 
- Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

## Goal:
Prediction of Disaster Tweets .

## Libraries used :
The required libraries for this project work
- Numpy==1.19.2
- Pandas==1.2.4
- Matplotlib==3.4.2
- Sklearn
- Seaborn

## Work Flow:
Load the dataset -> EDA -> Model Building -> Evaluation -> Deployment

- A breif view of the dataset

- Plot to check the null values.
## Models:
Naive Bayes:
- Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that is suitable for binary and multiclass classification. 
- It is a supervised classification technique used to classify future objects by assigning class labels to instances/records using conditional probability.

Logistic regression:
- Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method used to predict a data value based on prior observations of a data set. 
- A logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables.


## Accuracy:

Naive Bayes:  64.279902
Logistic regression: 62.655205

## Conclusion:
- Naive Bayes has the highest accuracy, hence we will be choosing that for building the project.
