# INTRODUCTION TO OPENCV LIBRARY

---

# OpenCV

<p>OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.</p>

# Features of OpenCV Library

<p>Using OpenCV library, you can −</p>

- Read and write images

- Capture and save videos

- Process images (filter, transform)

- Perform feature detection

- Detect specific objects such as faces, eyes, cars, in the videos or images.

- Analyze the video, i.e., estimate the motion in it, subtract the background, and track objects in it.

# OpenCV Library Modules

<p>Following are the main library modules of the OpenCV library.</p>

<b>Core Functionality</b>

- This module covers the basic data structures such as Scalar, Point, Range, etc., that are used to build OpenCV applications. In addition to these, it also includes the multidimensional array Mat, which is used to store the images. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.core.

<b>Image Processing</b>

- This module covers various image processing operations such as image filtering, geometrical image transformations, color space conversion, histograms, etc. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.imgproc.

<b>Video</b>

- This module covers the video analysis concepts such as motion estimation, background subtraction, and object tracking. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.video.

<b>Video I/O</b>

- This module explains the video capturing and video codecs using OpenCV library. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.videoio.

<b>calib3d</b>

- This module includes algorithms regarding basic multiple-view geometry algorithms, single and stereo camera calibration, object pose estimation, stereo correspondence and elements of 3D reconstruction. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.calib3d.

<b>features2d</b>

- This module includes the concepts of feature detection and description. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.features2d.

<b>Objdetect</b>

- This module includes the detection of objects and instances of the predefined classes such as faces, eyes, mugs, people, cars, etc. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.objdetect.

<b>Highgui</b>

- This is an easy-to-use interface with simple UI capabilities. In the Java library of OpenCV, the features of this module is included in two different packages namely, org.opencv.imgcodecs and org.opencv.videoio.

# Applications of OpenCV

<p>There are lots of applications which are solved using OpenCV, some of them are listed below </p>
 
- face recognition
- Automated inspection and surveillance
- number of people – count (foot traffic in a mall, etc)
- Vehicle counting on highways along with their speeds
- Interactive art installations
- Anamoly (defect) detection in the manufacturing process (the odd defective products)
- Street view image stitching
- Video/image search and retrieval
- Robot and driver-less car navigation and control
- object recognition
- Medical image analysis
- Movies – 3D structure from motion
- TV Channels advertisement recognition
