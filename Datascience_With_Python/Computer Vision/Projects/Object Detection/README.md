# Object detection using deep learning with OpenCV and Python 

* Object Detection is a technology of computer vision, where things, human beings, building, cars can be detected as object in image and videos.
* Object detection is merely to recognize the object with bounding box in the image, where in image classification, we can simply classify that is an object in the image or not in terms of the likelihood.
* Object detection involves "image classification" and "image localization".

# When it comes to object detection, popular detection frameworks are

* SSD-MoibleNet
* YOLO

# Libraries used

* OpenCV(Python)
* Tenserflow object detection API

# Dataset used

* COCO dataset (comprises of 80 classes)

# Files Used
