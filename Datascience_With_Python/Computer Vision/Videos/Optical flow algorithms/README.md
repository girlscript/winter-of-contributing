- Optical flow or optic flow is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene.
- Optical flow can also be defined as the distribution of apparent velocities of movement of brightness pattern in an image.
- The concept of optical flow was introduced by the American psychologist James J. Gibson in the 1940s to describe the visual stimulus provided to animals moving through the world.
- The term optical flow is also used by roboticists, encompassing related techniques from image processing and control of navigation including motion detection, object segmentation, time-to-contact information, focus of expansion calculations, luminance, motion compensated encoding, and stereo disparity measurement.

## Uses

- Motion estimation and video compression have developed as a major aspect of optical flow research. 
-  While the optical flow field is superficially similar to a dense motion field derived from the techniques of motion estimation, optical flow is the study of not only the determination of the optical flow field itself, but also of its use in estimating the three-dimensional nature and structure of the scene, as well as the 3D motion of objects and the observer relative to the scene, most of them using the image Jacobian.
-  Optical flow was used by robotics researchers in many areas such as: object detection and tracking, image dominant plane extraction, movement detection, robot navigation and visual odometry.
-  Optical flow information has been recognized as being useful for controlling micro air vehicles.
-  The application of optical flow includes the problem of inferring not only the motion of the observer and objects in the scene, but also the structure of objects and the environment. Since awareness of motion and the generation of mental maps of the structure of our environment are critical components of animal (and human) vision, the conversion of this innate ability to a computer capability is similarly crucial in the field of machine vision.

## Conclusion

- Optical flow, or motion estimation, is a fundamental method of calculating the motion of image intensities, which may be ascribed to the motion of objects in the scene. Optical flow is an extremely fundamental concept that is utilized in one form or another in most video-processing algorithms. 
-  Optical-flow methods are based on computing estimates of the motion of the image intensities over time in a video.
-   The flow fields can then be analyzed to produce segmentations into regions, which might be associated with moving objects. 

- Optical-flow or motion-estimation algorithms can be used to detect and delineate independently moving objects, even in the presence of camera motion. Of course, optical-flow-based techniques are computationally complex, and hence require fast hardware and software solutions to implement. 
- Since optical flow is fundamentally a differential quantity, estimation of it is highly susceptible to noise; ameliorating the noise sensitivity can imply increases in complexity. 
- Therefore, smart camera-based video surveillance systems that use optical-flow calculations of some type must be equipped with substantial computational resources, for example, a dedicated DSP chip, FPGA, or other special-purpose acceleration device. 
- Indeed, it is because such technologies are being introduced to smart camera technology (along with wireless-networking capabilities) that video surveillance systems having significant intelligent capability are being envisioned and realized.
