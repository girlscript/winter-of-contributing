- Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are an approach to generative modeling using deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks.
- Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.
- GANs are a clever way of training a generative model by framing the problem as a supervised learning problem with two sub-models: the generator model that we train to generate new examples, and the discriminator model that tries to classify examples as either real (from the domain) or fake (generated). 
- The two models are trained together in a zero-sum game, adversarial, until the discriminator model is fooled about half the time, meaning the generator model is generating plausible examples.
- GANs are an exciting and rapidly changing field, delivering on the promise of generative models in their ability to generate realistic examples across a range of problem domains, most notably in image-to-image translation tasks such as translating photos of summer to winter or day to night, and in generating photorealistic photos of objects, scenes, and people that even humans cannot tell are fake.


- The GAN model architecture involves two sub-models: a generator model for generating new examples and a discriminator model for classifying whether generated examples are real, from the domain, or fake, generated by the generator model.

- **Generator**. Model that is used to generate new plausible examples from the problem domain.
- **Discriminator**. Model that is used to classify examples as real (from the domain) or fake (generated).

## The Generator Model

- The generator model takes a fixed-length random vector as input and generates a sample in the domain.

- The vector is drawn from randomly from a Gaussian distribution, and the vector is used to seed the generative process. After training, points in this multidimensional vector space will correspond to points in the problem domain, forming a compressed representation of the data distribution.

- This vector space is referred to as a latent space, or a vector space comprised of latent variables. Latent variables, or hidden variables, are those variables that are important for a domain but are not directly observable.

## The Discriminator Model
- The discriminator model takes an example from the domain as input (real or generated) and predicts a binary class label of real or fake (generated).

- The real example comes from the training dataset. The generated examples are output by the generator model.

- The discriminator is a normal (and well understood) classification model.

- After the training process, the discriminator model is discarded as we are interested in the generator.

- Sometimes, the generator can be repurposed as it has learned to effectively extract features from examples in the problem domain. Some or all of the feature extraction layers can be used in transfer learning applications using the same or similar input data.

## GANs as a Two Player Game
- Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning problem, as we discussed in the previous section, although a clever property of the GAN architecture is that the training of the generative model is framed as a supervised learning problem.

- The two models, the generator and discriminator, are trained together. The generator generates a batch of samples, and these, along with real examples from the domain, are provided to the discriminator and classified as real or fake.

- The discriminator is then updated to get better at discriminating real and fake samples in the next round, and importantly, the generator is updated based on how well, or not, the generated samples fooled the discriminator.

## GANs and Convolutional Neural Networks
- GANs typically work with image data and use Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, as the generator and discriminator models.

- The reason for this may be both because the first description of the technique was in the field of computer vision and used CNNs and image data, and because of the remarkable progress that has been seen in recent years using CNNs more generally to achieve state-of-the-art results on a suite of computer vision tasks such as object detection and face recognition.

- Modeling image data means that the latent space, the input to the generator, provides a compressed representation of the set of images or photographs used to train the model. It also means that the generator generates new images or photographs, providing an output that can be easily viewed and assessed by developers or users of the model.
