- Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are an approach to generative modeling using deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks.
- Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.
- GANs are a clever way of training a generative model by framing the problem as a supervised learning problem with two sub-models: the generator model that we train to generate new examples, and the discriminator model that tries to classify examples as either real (from the domain) or fake (generated). The two models are trained together in a zero-sum game, adversarial, until the discriminator model is fooled about half the time, meaning the generator model is generating plausible examples.

**Examples:**
- Examples of generative models include Latent Dirichlet Allocation, or LDA, and the Gaussian Mixture Model, or GMM.
- Deep learning methods can be used as generative models. Two popular examples include the Restricted Boltzmann Machine, or RBM, and the Deep Belief Network, or DBN.
- Two modern examples of deep learning generative modeling algorithms include the Variational Autoencoder, or VAE, and the Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN.

**Model:**
- The GAN model architecture involves two sub-models: a generator model for generating new examples and a discriminator model for classifying whether generated examples are real, from the domain, or fake, generated by the generator model.
           - Generator. Model that is used to generate new plausible examples from the problem domain.
           - Discriminator. Model that is used to classify examples as real (from the domain) or fake (generated).

**Advantages of GANs over Other Generative Models:**
- Data labelling is an expensive task. GANs are unsupervised, so no labelled data is required to train them.
- GANs currently generate the sharpest images. Adversarial training makes this possible. ...
- Both the networks in GAN can be trained using only backpropagation.

- GANs are an exciting and rapidly changing field, delivering on the promise of generative models in their ability to generate realistic examples across a range of problem domains, most notably in image-to-image translation tasks such as translating photos of summer to winter or day to night, and in generating photorealistic photos of objects, scenes, and people that even humans cannot tell are fake.
