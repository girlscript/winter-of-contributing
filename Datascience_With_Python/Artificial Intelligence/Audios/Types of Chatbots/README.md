# WHAT IS A CHATBOT ?

- A chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation (either written or spoken), allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person. 
- Chatbots can be as simple as rudimentary programs that answer a simple query with a single-line response, or as sophisticated as digital assistants that learn and evolve to deliver increasing levels of personalization as they gather and process information.

## 1. Support Chatbots :

- Designed to solve a specific problem, support chatbots require context awareness, a personality and multi-turn capability. They should be able to walk a user through a business process and answer wide range of FAQs. Most of the support chatbots use deep learning and natural language processing to perform actions. Speech recognition is optional for support chatbots.
- A support chatbot finds use in all industries - majorly in retail, human resources, digital marketing and healthcare. Use of chatbots for consumer services in all these industries is becoming a necessity as it saves business resources, and improves customer satisfaction rate.

## 2. Skills Chatbots :

- It’s a single-turn-type chatbot that doesn’t require much of contextual awareness. It can just follow a command to perform an action. For example, a skills chatbot can follow the command ‘switch on the lights’ readily, with its speech recognition functionality. A skills chatbot requires powerful NLP features as well as must be quick to work.
- Amazon’s Alexa has great skills chatbots feature, though it’s a bot that can be classified into several types of chatbots.

## 3. Assistant Bots:

- Assistant bots, like support bots, need to be good at conversations and answering FAQs. They must also be entertaining to maintain user interest. The most successful example of assistant bots is Siri by Apple, which can not only assist the user with several tasks like fetching the news, making a google search, setting reminders etc but also responds in a funny way if it doesn’t understand the query.
- There are several assistant bots that can integrate with existing platforms like Slack, Facebook and websites to assist with relevant business processes.

## 4. Transactional Bots:

- These bots can be roughly classified into assistant bots as they often act on behalf of humans to perform various transactions. For example, placing an order, making a reservation etc. Several custom solutions for transactional bots are possible, helping users increase their productivity as the bot interacts with external systems to perform transactions.
- Transactional bots find use in several industries just like support chatbots.

## 5. Informational & Information Gathering Bots:

- Both types of bots help either in collecting or in distributing information. For example, a news bot (an informational bot) can send push notifications or offer news recommendations to users with use of AI and text classification technologies.
- Information gathering bots can act as research assistants by extracting as much information as possible either from a human or from an internet resource like a website or an ebook.
- Information gathering bots are very relevant in the education and corporate training sector as well as in the digital marketing sector for research-based tasks.

## 6. Conversational Chatbots:

- Several put conversational bots as a separate category but with the current user requirements and technology, each bot must be able to have a conversation with a human in some way or another. 
- Hence, all types of bots are ultimately conversational chatbots.
