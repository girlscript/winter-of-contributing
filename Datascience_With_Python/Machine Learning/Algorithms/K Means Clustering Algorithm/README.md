## **Introduction**

- K means clustering algorithm comes under unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm where no labelled data is used,it divides the dataset into k-number of clusters, and repeats the process until it does not find the best clusters.

- It is generally used in clustering based problems in Data Science.

- Let's understand the working of this algorithm by a project example by following steps as below:

 1. Data Preprocessing.
 2. Model Creation.
 3. Visualization.

## **Purpose** 

The main purpose of this algorithm is to find the optimal number of cluters and solve clustering based problems in Machine Learning & Data Science.

## **Features**

- Finds the optimal number of clusters.

- Data can be analysed and visualized properly and neatly.

## **Brief summary** 

K means clutering algorithm is used for clustering based problems where it finds the optimal number of clusters present in the data. Firstly, we have to preprocess the data to know better about the data we'll be using.
Then visualize the data for better understanding which is followed by application of elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.
Finally, visualized the number of clusters along with their centriods.
