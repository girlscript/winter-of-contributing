This is a readme file about the topic Overview of Regression
************************************************************************************
- Regression is a problem of predicting a real-valued label (often called a target) given an unlabeled example. Estimating house price valuation based on house features, such as area,the number of bedrooms, location and so on is a famous example of regression.
- The regression problem is solved by a regression learning algorithm that takes a collection of labeled examples as inputs and produces a model that can take an unlabeled example as input and output a target.

In the attached .ipynb you can find about Regression and how to evaluate it with some basics on Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.
