### Introduction:
Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

### Purpose:
It can be utilised to perform a number of mathematical operations on arrays such as trigonometric, statistical, and algebraic routines. It is used in the industry for array computing.Therefore, the library contains a large number of mathematical, algebraic, and transformation functions.

### Features:
* High-performance N-dimensional array object.
* It contains tools for integrating code from C/C++ and Fortran.
* It contains a multidimensional container for generic data.
* Additional linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.
* It consists of broadcasting functions.
* It had data type definition capability to work with varied databases.
