## Introduction to Seaborn
Seaborn in python issued to create graphics which is easy to manage. Seaborn is a library provided by python, which basically helps to visualize the data and make it more and more undertakable by the user. With the help of the library, we can plot our data and make a graphical representation of it. Internally this library uses matplotlib; in short, it is based on matplotlib only. This also makes it efficient to create attractive and more informative graphics representations of our data. This library is integrated with the panda’s data structure.

## Installation and Importing Seaborn Library
To install seaborn
```
pip install seaborn
```
To Import seaborn
```
import seaborn as sns
```

## Different types of plots in seaborn
1. Bar Plot
2. Swarm Plot
3. Count Plot
4. Box Plot
5. Violin Plot
6. Strip Plot
7. Point Plot
8. Dist Plot
9. Joint Plot
10. Pair Plot
11. Rug Plot
12. Heat Map

Above plots are explained and shown in notebook or you can click video link to see all plots which are mentioned above.

## Advantages of Seaborn
1. By using the seaborn library, we can easily represent our data on a plot.
2. Inside this, we can switch to any other representation of data using the ‘kind’ property inside it.
3. It creates an interactive and informative plot to representation our data; also, this is easy for the user to understand and visualize the records on the application.
4. It uses static aggregation for plot generation in python.
5. As it is based on the matplotlib so while installing seaborn, we also have other libraries installed, out of which we have matplotlib, which also provides several features and functions to create more interactive plots in python.

## Usage of Seaborn
1. Data visualization
2. Use to show data as a line plot.
3. Use to create high level informative and attractive plots to show the data.

## Conclusion
We have already discussed that it is basically used for data visualization because, in our application, we have a large amount of data that needs to be represented to the user in some readable and undertakable format, so seaborn helps the user to visualize data in the form of graphics. which makes it attractive and efficient. For better understanding you can go to the video link or notebook to get detailed information of seaborn.
