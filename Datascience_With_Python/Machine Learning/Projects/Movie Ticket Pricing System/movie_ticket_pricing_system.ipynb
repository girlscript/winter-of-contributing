They figured out that not all customers are the same, they all have different concerns and different priorities.\n","\n","* While some customers want tickets at a cheaper price while others want good service. This method is now used in all movie booking systems.\n","\n","* There are some parameters, depends on which the price varies, like whether the customer wants to book a ticket in the front row or the back, or the customer wants an executive seat or a couple of seats. \n","\n","* Not only the seats, but prices also depend on where the movie hall is located and which show timing the customer has chosen.\n","\n","* The other way is to come up with discounts or to give users with customized offers for a limited period. In other words, dynamic pricing is a prediction problem, where machine learning is the best tool to tackle it.\n","\n","# Hardware and Software used:\n","\n","* A suitable OS.\n","\n","* A desktop or laptop.\n","\n","* Enough RAM to run the program without any interruption.\n","\n","* Python 3 or upwards installed on your system.\n","\n","# Implementations:\n","\n","* Decide the public you are aiming at.\n","\n","* Mention the type of customer you are aiming.\n","\n","* Collect historical data from on different price points offered in the past as well as the demand for these points.\n","\n","* Build a model to predict the different parameters.\n","\n","* Use an optimization algorithm to discover the optimal price and product features, to maximize the probability of purchasing. This method can also be used for creating product bundles and discounts.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","# **IMPLEMENTATION OF MOVIE TICKET PRICING SYSTEM USING PYTHON**\n","\n","# **APPROACH:**\n","\n","##  **1. t_movie:** This method is used to select the movie name.\n","\n","      def t_movie():\n","          global f\n","          f = f+1\n","          print(\"which movie do you want to watch?\")\n","          print(\"1,movie 1 \")\n","          print(\"2,movie 2 \")\n","          print(\"3,movie 3\")\n","          print(\"4,back\")\n","          movie = int(input(\"choose your movie: \"))\n","          if movie == 4:\n","            # in this it goes to center function and\n","            # from center it goes to movie function \n","            # and it comes back here and then go to theater \n","            center()\n","            theater()\n","            return 0\n","          if f == 1:\n","            theater()\n","## **2. theater():** This method is used to select the screen.\n","\n","\n","      def theater():\n","          print(\"which screen do you want to watch movie: \")\n","          print(\"1,SCREEN 1\")\n","          print(\"2,SCREEN 2\")\n","          print(\"3,SCREEN 3\")\n","          a = int(input(\"choose your screen: \"))\n","          ticket = int(input(\"number of ticket do you want?: \"))\n","          timing(a)\n","## **3. timing(a):** This method is used to select timing for movies.\n","\n"," \n","      def timing(a):\n","          time1 = {\n","              \"1\": \"10.00-1.00\",\n","              \"2\": \"1.10-4.10\",\n","              \"3\": \"4.20-7.20\",\n","              \"4\": \"7.30-10.30\"\n","          }\n","          time2 = {\n","              \"1\": \"10.15-1.15\",\n","              \"2\": \"1.25-4.25\",\n","              \"3\": \"4.35-7.35\",\n","              \"4\": \"7.45-10.45\"\n","          }\n","          time3 = {\n","              \"1\": \"10.30-1.30\",\n","              \"2\": \"1.40-4.40\",\n","              \"3\": \"4.50-7.50\",\n","              \"4\": \"8.00-10.45\"\n","          }\n","          if a == 1:\n","              print(\"choose your time:\")\n","              print(time1)\n","              t = input(\"select your time:\")\n","              x = time1[t]\n","              print(\"successfull!, enjoy movie at \"+x)\n","          elif a == 2:\n","              print(\"choose your time:\")\n","              print(time2)\n","              t = input(\"select your time:\")\n","              x = time2[t]\n","              print(\"successfull!, enjoy movie at \"+x)\n","          elif a == 3:\n","              print(\"choose your time:\")\n","              print(time3)\n","              t = input(\"select your time:\")\n","              x = time3[t]\n","              print(\"successfull!, enjoy movie at \"+x)\n","          return 0\n","\n","## **4. movie(theater):** This method is used to select movies accordingly to the theater.\n","\n","      def movie(theater):\n","          if theater == 1:\n","              t_movie()\n","          elif theater == 2:\n","              t_movie()\n","          elif theater == 3:\n","              t_movie()\n","          elif theater == 4:\n","              city()\n","          else:\n","              print(\"wrong choice\")\n","\n","## **5. center():** This method is used to select the theater.\n","\n","      def center():\n","          print(\"which theater do you wish to see movie?
