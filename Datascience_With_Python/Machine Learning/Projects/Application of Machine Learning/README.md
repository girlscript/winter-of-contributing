To collect application of AI and connect them with machine learning algorithm

## :nazar_amulet: Introduction
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.
   Although machine learning is a field within computer science, it differs from traditional computational approaches. In traditional computing, algorithms are sets of explicitly programmed instructions used by computers to calculate or problem solve. Machine learning algorithms instead allow for computers to train on data inputs and use statistical analysis in order to output values that fall within a specific range. Because of this, machine learning facilitates computers in building models from sample data in order to automate decision-making processes based on data inputs.Any technology user today has benefitted from machine learning.

## :nazar_amulet: Applications

### :stars:House Price Prediction:

Prediction house prices are expected to help people who plan to buy a house so they can know the price range in the future, then they can plan their finance well. In addition, house price predictions are also beneficial for property investors to know the trend of housing prices in a certain location. 

#### This can be done using Linear Regression

### :stars:Text classification:
  
 Text classifiers can be used to determine sentiment in social media texts, predict categories of news articles, parse and segment unstructured documents, flag the highly talked about fake news articles and more.
Text classifiers work by leveraging signals in the text to “guess” the most appropriate classification. For example, in a sentiment classification task, occurrences of certain words or phrases, like slow,problem,wouldn't and not can bias the classifier to predict negative sentiment.
  
#### This can be done using Logistic Regression

### :stars: Detection of fraud:
  
A type of yellow journalism, fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread through social media and other online media. This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas. Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims, and may end up being viralized by algorithms, and users may end up in a filter bubble.
  
#### This can be implemented using Decision tree or random forest algorithm.

For better understanding , I have implemented Credit card fraud detection using Random forest.

## :nazar_amulet: Need for ML:
Ever since the technical revolution, we’ve been generating an immeasurable amount of data. As per research, we generate around 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every single day! It is estimated that by 2020, 1.7MB of data will be created every second for every person on earth.

With the availability of so much data, it is finally possible to build predictive models that can study and analyze complex data to find useful insights and deliver more accurate results.

Top Tier companies such as Netflix and Amazon build such Machine Learning models by using tons of data in order to identify profitable opportunities and avoid unwanted risks.

Here’s a list of reasons why Machine Learning is so important:
#### :stars: Increase in Data Generation: 
Due to excessive production of data, we need a method that can be used to structure, analyze and draw useful insights from data. This is where Machine Learning comes in. It uses data to solve problems and find solutions to the most complex tasks faced by organizations.
#### :stars: Improve Decision Making:
By making use of various algorithms, Machine Learning can be used to make better business decisions. For example, Machine Learning is used to forecast sales, predict downfalls in the stock market, identify risks and anomalies, etc.


## :nazar_amulet: Conclusion:
Machine learning is quickly growing field in computer science. It has applications in nearly every other field of study and is already being implemented commercially because machine learning can solve problems too difficult or time consuming for humans to solve.
Nowadays, ML is an exciting major of research in computer science and engineering. Also, it is used in various areas and fields in real-life during these days such as finance, CRM, self-driving cars, business intelligence, and so on. In fact, Machine Learning allows software to become accurate in predicting outcomes.

This documentaion showcased some simple use cases for ML. There are many other relevant solutions, tools, and libraries that can be used for the different applications .
