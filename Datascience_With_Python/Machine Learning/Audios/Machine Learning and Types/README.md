- With machine learning algorithms, AI was able to develop beyond just performing the tasks it was programmed to do. 
- Before ML entered the mainstream, AI programs were only used to automate low-level tasks in business and enterprise settings.
- This included tasks like intelligent automation or simple rule-based classification. 
- This meant that AI algorithms were restricted to only the domain of what they were processed for. 
- However, with machine learning, computers were able to move past doing what they were programmed and began evolving with each iteration.

**Types of Machine Learning:**
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

**Supervised Learning**
- Supervised learning is one of the most basic types of machine learning. 
- In this type, the machine learning algorithm is trained on labeled data. 
- Even though the data needs to be labeled accurately for this method to work, supervised learning is extremely powerful when used in the right circumstances.

**Unsupervised Learning**
- Unsupervised machine learning holds the advantage of being able to work with unlabeled data. 
- This means that human labor is not required to make the dataset machine-readable, allowing much larger datasets to be worked on by the program.

**Reinforcement Learning**
- Reinforcement learning directly takes inspiration from how human beings learn from data in their lives. 
- It features an algorithm that improves upon itself and learns from new situations using a trial-and-error method. 
- Favorable outputs are encouraged or ‘reinforced’, and non-favorable outputs are discouraged or ‘punished’.

**Applications of Machine Learning:**
- Machine learning algorithms are used in circumstances where the solution is required to continue improving post-deployment. T
- The dynamic nature of adaptable machine learning solutions is one of the main selling points for its adoption by companies and organizations across verticals.
- Machine learning algorithms and solutions are versatile and can be used as a substitute for medium-skilled human labor given the right circumstances. 
- For example, customer service executives in large B2C companies have now been replaced by natural language processing machine learning algorithms known as chatbots. 
- These chatbots can analyze customer queries and provide support for human customer support executives or deal with the customers directly.
- Machine learning algorithms also help to improve user experience and customization for online platforms. 
- Facebook, Netflix, Google, and Amazon all use recommendation systems to prevent content glut and provide unique content to individual users based on their likes and dislikes.
