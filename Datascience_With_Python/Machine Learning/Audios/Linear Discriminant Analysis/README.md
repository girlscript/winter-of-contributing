- It is a supervised machine learning model
- It is one of the dimensional reduction techniques
-  It is used to convert the higher dimensional space into a lower dimension space. 
-  It uses both the axes (X and Y) to create a new axis. Hence, reducing the 2D graph into a 1D graph.
- Two criteria are used to create a new axis: 
         - Maximize the distance between means of the two classes.
         - Minimize the variation within each class

**The extensions to LDA:**
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis(QDA) 
- Flexible Discriminant Analysis(FDA) 
- Regularized Discriminant Analysis(RDA)

**Advantages:**
- It helps in reducing the dimensions of the dataset
- It helps in reducing the complexity 
- Increases the performance
 
**Disadvantages:**
- It is Non-hierarchical in nature
- It is a Static approach
- It works weakly in sentimental analysis.
- It works very differently in the case of the bag of words.

**Real-Life Applications of LDA:**
- Face Recognition 
- Medical 
- Customer Identification 

**Conclusion:**
- LDA can be simply and easily applied in data science without any effort. It is used to reduce the dimension of the data set. It is used in many classification problems.
