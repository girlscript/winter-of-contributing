- Ordinary least squares regression (OLSR) is a generalized linear modeling technique. 
- It is used for estimating all unknown parameters involved in a linear regression model, the goal of which is to minimize the sum of the squares of the difference of the observed variables and the explanatory variables.
- Ordinary least squares regression is also known as ordinary least squares or least squared errors regression.

**Advantages:**
- The statistical method reveals information about cost structures and distinguishes between different variablesâ€™ roles in affecting output. Coefficients can be interpreted in terms of cost drivers or how inputs contribute to output.

**Disadvantages:**
- Large data set is necessary in order to obtain reliable results. The regression results are sensitive to functional form if the error term is not adequately interpreted, which can lead to widely varying conclusions, depending on how the regression is initially set up.

**Application:** 
- The UK water regulator OFWAT applies mean and average methods to the operating costs (OPEX) and capital expenditures (CAPEX) of water utilities when determining the price caps every five years. OFWAT has developed an efficiency analysis relying on mean and average methods that is a key part of its price determination process.

**Overview:**
- Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS) is a common technique for estimating coefficients of linear regression equations which describe the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable (simple or multiple linear regression). 
- Least squares stands for the minimum squares error (SSE). Maximum likelihood and Generalized method of moments estimator are alternative approaches to OLS.
