**Polynomial Regression:**
- Polynomial Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm.
- It is the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables as nth degree
polynomial.
- Equation:

y= b0 + b1 x1^1 + b2 x1^2 + b3 x1^3 +......+ bn x1^n

**Why do we use Polynomial regression?**
- Polynomial regression is a special type of multiple linear regression.
- Multiple linear regression is converted to polynomial regression by adding the polynomial terms to 
the linear equation.
- It is a linear model with some modification in order to increase the accuracy.
- When data points are arranged in a non-linear fashion, we need the Polynomial Regression model.

**Advantages:**
- Model accuracy is increases.
- For non-linear data points we can draw the best fit line.

**Disadvantages:**
- Model complexity increases.
- Training time increases.
- In some cases, it might lead to overfitting for the data values

**Overview on regression models:**

**Simple Linear Regression**

- Simple Linear Regression establishes the relationship between two variables using a straight line. It attempts to draw a line that comes closest to the data by finding the slope and intercept which define the line and minimize regression errors. Simple linear regression has only one x and one y variable.

**Multi Linear Regression:**

- Multiple Linear regressions are based on the assumption that there is a linear relationship between both the dependent and independent variables or Predictor variable and Target variable. It also assumes that there is no major correlation between the independent variables. Multi Linear regressions can be linear and nonlinear. It has one y and two or more x variables or one dependent variable and two or more independent variables.

**Polynomial Regression:**

- Polynomial Regression is a one of the types of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y..

- Polynomial Regression provides the best approximation of the relationship between the dependent and independent variable.
