- Bayesian linear regression allows a fairly natural mechanism to survive insufficient data, or poor distributed data. 
- It allows you to put a prior on the coefficients and on the noise so that in the absence of data, the priors can take over.
- More importantly, you can ask Bayesian linear regression which parts (if any) of its fit to the data is it confident about, and which parts are very uncertain (perhaps based entirely on the priors).

- The output is achieved from a probability distribution, rather than usual regression techniques. 
- The goal of Bayesian linear regression is to find Posterior instead of model parameters.

**Advantages and disadvantages:**
- It’s good when you have a linear regression problem and want to use a Bayesian approach.
- With the help of Bayesian processing, we can retrieve the complete variety of inferential solutions instead of a point estimate.
- It works efficiently with the small size of the dataset.
- It is very suitable for the online form of learning, whereas, in the form of batch learning, we have the whole dataset.
- It is a very powerful and tested approach.
- It’s not great when you don’t have a regression problem, or if a linear model does not work well, or if you do not want a Bayesian approach.

**Conclusion:**
- Many advantages can be taken with Bayesian linear regression and is one of the natural mechanism to calculate insufficient or poorly distributed data.
- A Bayesian viewpoint is an instinctive form of seeing the world. 
- To its frequent counterpart, Bayesian Inference can embellish a very convenient substitute. 
- It is used in various fields like data-science, machine learning, and many more. 
- It helps in building various models with the help of which we can solve many problems.
