- Machine learning applications provide analytics and insights gleaned from available data which contribute to actionable decision-making in businesses. 
- Since machine learning revolves around studying and implementing algorithms, it is important to bolster your mathematical skills. 
- It helps in eliminating uncertainty and predicting data values accurately where complex data parameters and features are involved. 
- It also aids us in better understanding the Bias-Variance trade-off. 
- Mastering machine learning requires knowledge of mathematical concepts like linear algebra, vector calculus, analytical geometry, matrix decompositions, probability and statistics. 
- A strong grasp of these helps in creating intuitive machine learning applications.

**Basic Math Required for Machine Learning:**
- Multivariate Calculus:
    - In calculus, you will learn about integrals, derivatives, and gradient descent. Integrals and derivatives are vital for modeling different types of distributions of data and creating simulations. Gradient descent is the key to learning about neural networks.
- Statistics
    - The first things to understand in statistics are probability theory and Bayes Theorem. Probability is the idea of distributions and randomness
- Discrete Math
    - Discrete mathematics is the foundational knowledge behind computer science. It involves inductive and deductive reasoning, graph theory, recursion, and algorithm complexity. Itâ€™s about evaluating models based on the time and difficulty involved in making them.
- Linear Algebra
    - Linear algebra is integral to many machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning. The most important parts are matrices and vectors because they are a major component of Python.
