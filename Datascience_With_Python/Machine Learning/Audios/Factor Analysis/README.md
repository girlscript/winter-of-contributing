## **Introduction**

Developed in 1904 by Spearman, Factor Analysis (FA) is an exploratory data analysis method used to search influential underlying factors or latent variables from a set of observed variables. 
It helps in data interpretations by reducing the number of variables. It extracts maximum common variance from all variables and puts them into a common score.


## **Factor Analysis**

Factor analysis is a linear statistical model. It is used to explain the variance among the observed variable and condense a set of the observed variable into the unobserved variable called factors. Observed variables are modeled as a linear combination of factors and error terms (Source). Factor or latent variable is associated with multiple observed variables, who have common patterns of responses. Each factor explains a particular amount of variance in the observed variables. It helps in data interpretations by reducing the number of variables.


## **Assumptions**

+ There are no outliers in data.
+ Sample size should be greater than the factor.
+ There should not be perfect multicollinearity.
+ There should not be homoscedasticity between the variables.


## **How does factor analysis work**

The primary objective of factor analysis is to reduce the number of observed variables and find unobservable variables. These unobserved variables help the market researcher to conclude the survey. This conversion of the observed variables to unobserved variables can be achieved in two steps:

+ ***Factor Extraction***: In this step, the number of factors and approach for extraction selected using variance partitioning methods such as principal components analysis and common factor analysis.

+ ***Factor Rotation***: In this step, rotation tries to convert factors into uncorrelated factors â€” the main goal of this step to improve the overall interpretability. There are lots of rotation methods that are available such as: Varimax rotation method, Quartimax rotation method, and Promax rotation method.

## **Types of Factor Analysis**

+ **Confirmatory Factor Analysis**
 
As the name of this concept suggests, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) lets one determine whether a relationship between factors or a set of overserved variables and their underlying components exists. 

 
It helps one confirm whether there is a connection between two components of variables in a given dataset. Usually, the purpose of CFA is to test whether certain data fit the requirements of a particular hypothesis. 


+ **Exploratory Factor Analysis**
 
In the case of Exploratory Factor Statistical Analysis, the purpose is to determine/explore the underlying latent structure of a large set of variables. EFA, unlike CFA, tends to uncover the relationship, if any, between measured variables of an entity. 
Conducting Exploratory Factor Analysis involves figuring the total number of factors involved in a dataset. 

 While CFA works on finding a relationship between a set of observed variables and their underlying structure, this works to uncover a relationship between various variables within a given dataset. 


## **Applications of Factor Analysis**

Following are the applications of factor analysis -

+ ***Marketing***
 
When it comes to Factor Analysis in marketing, one can benefit immensely from this statistical method. 

In order to boost marketing campaigns and accelerate success, in the long run, companies employ Factor Analysis techniques that help to find a correlation between various variables or factors of a marketing campaign. Moreover, FA also helps to establish connections with customer satisfaction and consequent feedback after a marketing campaign in order to check its efficacy and impact on the audiences. 


+ ***Data Mining***
 
In data mining, Factor Analysis can play a role as important as that of artificial intelligence. Owing to its ability to transform a complex and vast dataset into a group of filtered out variables that are related to each other in some way or the other, FA eases out the process of data mining. 
However, with the help of this statistical method, data mining has become much more advanced. 


+ ***Machine Learning***
 
As Factor Analysis in machine learning helps in reducing the number of variables in a given dataset to procure a more accurate and enhanced set of observed factors, various machine learning algorithms are put to use to work accordingly. 

An unsupervised machine learning algorithm, FA is largely used for dimensionality reduction in machine learning. Thereby, machine learning can very well collaborate with Factor Analysis to give rise to data mining techniques and make the task of data research massively efficient. 


## **Pros of Factor Analysis**
 
+ ***Measurable Attributes***
 
The first and foremost pro of FA is that it is open to all measurable attributes. Be it subjective or objective, any kind of attribute can be worked upon when it comes to this statistical technique. Unlike some statistical models that only work on objective attributes, Factor Analysis goes well with both subjective and objective attributes. 

 
+ ***Cost-Effective***
 
While data research and data mining algorithms can cost a lot due to the extraordinary charges, this statistical model is cost-effective and does not take many resources to work with. 

 
+ ***Flexible Approach***
 
While many machine learning algorithms are rigid and constricted to a single approach, Factor Analysis does not work that way. Rather, this statistical model has a flexible approach towards multivariate datasets that let one obtain relationships or correlations between various variables and their underlying components. 

 
**Cons of Factor Analysis**
 

+ ***Incomprehensive Results***
 
Factor Analysis can procure incompetent results due to incomprehensive datasets. While various data points can have similar traits, some other variables or factors can go unnoticed due to being isolated in a vast dataset. That said, the results of this method could be incomprehensive. 

+ ***Non-Identification of Complicated Factors***
 
Another drawback of Factor Analysis is that it does not identify complicated factors that underlie a dataset. While some results could clearly indicate a correlation between two variables, some complicated correlations can go unnoticed in such a method. Perhaps the non-identification of complicated factors and their relationships could be an issue for data research. 

 
+ ***Reliant on Theory***
 
Even though Factor Analysis skills can be imitated by machine learning algorithms, this method is still reliant on theory and thereby data researchers. Thus, one of the major drawbacks of Factor Analysis is that it is somehow reliant on theory and cannot fully function without manual assistance.
