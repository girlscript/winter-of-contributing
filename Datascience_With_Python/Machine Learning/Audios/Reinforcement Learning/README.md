- It is a part of  Machine Learning. 
- It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. 
- It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. 
- Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. 
- In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.

**Pros:**
- Reinforcement learning can be used to solve very complex problems that cannot be solved by conventional techniques.
- This technique is preferred to achieve long-term results, which are very difficult to achieve.
- This learning model is very similar to the learning of human beings. Hence, it is close to achieving perfection.
- The model can correct the errors that occurred during the training process.

**Cons:**
- Reinforcement learning as a framework is wrong in many different ways, but it is precisely this quality that makes it useful.
- Too much reinforcement learning can lead to an overload of states, which can diminish the results.
- Reinforcement learning is not preferable to use for solving simple problems.

**Applications:**
- Reinforcement learning can be used effectively to determine the best move to make in a game, depending on several different factors. 
- It is very handy in games like Chess, Go, etc.
- Using reinforcement learning, we can improve and personalize the gaming experience in real-time. 
- It is the algorithm that can solve different games and sometimes achieve super-human performance.

**Conclusion:**
- Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning in which the machine learns by itself after making many mistakes and correcting them.
- This learning strategy has many advantages, as well as some disadvantages. I found it hard to find more than a few disadvantages of reinforcement learning.
