## Introduction
PyBrain is a modular Machine Learning Library for Python. Its goal is to offer flexible, easy-to-use yet still powerful algorithms for Machine Learning Tasks and a variety of predefined environments to test and compare your algorithms.
It is an open-source library for Machine learning implemented using python. The library offers you some easy to use training algorithms for networks, datasets, trainers to train and test the network.

PyBrain is short for Python-Based Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Network Library.

## How is PyBrain different?

While there are a few machine learning libraries out there, PyBrain aims to be a very easy-to-use modular library that can be used by entry-level students but still offers the flexibility and algorithms for state-of-the-art research.

Its library is built around neural networks in the kernel and all of the training methods accept a neural network as the to-be-trained instance. This makes PyBrain a powerful tool for real-life tasks.

## Features of Pybrain
The following are the features of Pybrain library −

+ Supervised Learning
+ Unsupervised Learning
+ Reinforcement Learning
+ Black-box Optimization
+ Network Architectures
+ Toy Environments
+ 3D Environments
+ Function Environments
+ Pole-Balancing


## Advantages of Pybrain
The advantages of Pybrain are −

+ Pybrain is an open-source free library to learn Machine Learning. It is a good start for any newcomer interested in Machine Learning.

+ Pybrain uses python to implement it and that makes it fast in development in comparison to languages like Java/C++.

+ Pybrain works easily with other libraries of python to visualize data.

+ Pybrain offers support for popular networks like Feed-Forward Network, Recurrent Networks, Neural Networks, etc.

+ Working with .csv to load datasets is very easy in Pybrain. It also allows using datasets from another library.

+ Training and testing of data are easy using Pybrain trainers.


## Workflow of Pybrain

At the start, we have raw data which after preprocessing can be used with Pybrain. 
The flow of PyBrain starts with datasets which are divided into trained and test data.

+ the network is created, and the dataset and the network are given to the trainer.

+ the trainer trains the data on the network and classifies the outputs as trained error and validation error which can be visualized.

+ the tested data can be validated to see if the output matches the trained data.

## Summary
In PyBrain we emphasize simplicity, compositionality and the ability to combine various architectures and algorithm types.
Pybrain is easy to use, and is well-documented, both in code and in documents and tutorials explaining the use of the basic capabilities of the library

Among machine learning libraries written in Python, PyBrain stands out for its combination of breadth, versatility and maturity of development.
