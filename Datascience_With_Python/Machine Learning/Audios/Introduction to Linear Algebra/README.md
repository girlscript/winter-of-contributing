- Introduction to Linear Algebra
- It is a branch of mathematics
- It is about linear combinations
- It is a study line for lines, planes, vectors, and matrices.
- It is a path for linear equations, which is a collection of unknowns along with constants and mathematical operations.
- This linear algebra is a description of a two-dimensional graph.

**Linear Algebra and Statistics:**
- It is used in multivariate statistics with the help of vectors and matrices.
- It is a path for analysis of regression algorithms like linear regression, polynomial regression, and logistic regression.
- It helps in the calculation of least squares and weighted least squares
- Mean and median calculations
- Principal component analysis for data reduction draws many of these elements together.
