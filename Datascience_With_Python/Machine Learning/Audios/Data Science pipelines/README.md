A data science pipeline is the set of processes that convert raw data into actionable answers to business questions. Data science pipelines automate the flow of data from source to destination, ultimately providing you insights for making business decisions.
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on extracting knowledge from data sets that are typically huge in amount. The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, statics, information visualization, graphic, and business
Data pipelines are created using one or more software technologies to automate the unification, management and visualization of your structured business data, usually for strategic purposes.

**Benefits:**
- Easier access to insights, as raw data is quickly and easily adjusted, analyzed, and modeled based on machine learning algorithms, then output as meaningful, actionable information
- Faster decision-making, as data is extracted and processed in real time, giving you up-to-date information to leverage
- Agility to meet peaks in demand, as modern data science pipelines offer instant elasticity via the cloud

**What affects the complexity of your data pipeline?**
- Number of different data sources (business systems)
- Types of data sources, whether they are complex or simple
- Type of connectivity to the data sources
- Volume of data
- Velocity of data

**What is the purpose of a data pipeline?**
Data pipelines enable the flow of data from an application to a data warehouse, from a data lake to an analytics database, or into a payment processing system, for example. Data pipelines also may have the same source and sink, such that the pipeline is purely about modifying the data set.

**Overview:**
Data pipelines, by consolidating data from all your disparate sources into one common destination, enable quick data analysis for business insights. They also ensure consistent data quality, which is absolutely crucial for reliable business insights.
