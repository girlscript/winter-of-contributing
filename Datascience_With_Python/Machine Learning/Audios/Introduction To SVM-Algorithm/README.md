Contribution Approaches-
Support Vector Machines(SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for both Regression and Classification but it is mostly used for classification and specifically with binary class classification. SVM does not properly support multi class classification directly so we break our problem into smaller sub problems. Unlike Logistic Regression it works well on complex and large datasets too. The datapoints on the plot area are separated by a boundary line which is called the hyperplane/kernel. This line separates the classes from one another. Also there are points from each class which are nearest to the hyperplane those points are called support vectors/extreme points. And while choosing our hyperplane for a particular problem we take care that the distance between two extreme points is maximised. The kernel choosen for a problem completely depends on the distribution of the data points. Sometimes we even take help of data transformation to convert a non separable dataset to a separable dataset
