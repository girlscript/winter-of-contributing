**CatBoost:**
- CatBoost is a recently open-sourced machine learning algorithm from Yandex. 
- It can easily integrate with deep learning frameworks like Google’s TensorFlow and Apple’s Core ML. 
- It can work with diverse data types to help solve a wide range of problems that businesses face today. 
- To top it up, it provides best-in-class accuracy.
- It is especially powerful in two ways:
      - It yields state-of-the-art results without extensive data training typically required by other machine learning methods, and
      - Provides powerful out-of-the-box support for the more descriptive data formats that accompany many business problems.
- “CatBoost” name comes from two words “Category” and “Boosting”.
