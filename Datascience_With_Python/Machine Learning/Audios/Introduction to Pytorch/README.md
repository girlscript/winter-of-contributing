- PyTorch is defined as an open source machine learning library for Python. It is used for applications such as natural language processing. It is initially developed by Facebook artificial-intelligence research group, and Uber’s Pyro software for probabilistic programming which is built on it.

- Originally, PyTorch was developed by Hugh Perkins as a Python wrapper for the LusJIT based on Torch framework. There are two PyTorch variants.

- PyTorch redesigns and implements Torch in Python while sharing the same core C libraries for the backend code. PyTorch developers tuned this back-end code to run Python efficiently. They also kept the GPU based hardware acceleration as well as the extensibility features that made Lua-based Torch.

## Features
The major features of PyTorch are mentioned below −

- Easy Interface − PyTorch offers easy to use API; hence it is considered to be very simple to operate and runs on Python. The code execution in this framework is quite easy.

- Python usage − This library is considered to be Pythonic which smoothly integrates with the Python data science stack. Thus, it can leverage all the services and functionalities offered by the Python environment.

- Computational graphs − PyTorch provides an excellent platform which offers dynamic computational graphs. Thus a user can change them during runtime. This is highly useful when a developer has no idea of how much memory is required for creating a neural network model.

### PyTorch is known for having three levels of abstraction as given below −

- Tensor − Imperative n-dimensional array which runs on GPU.

- Variable − Node in computational graph. This stores data and gradient.

- Module − Neural network layer which will store state or learnable weights.

## Advantages of PyTorch
The following are the advantages of PyTorch −

- It is easy to debug and understand the code.

- It includes many layers as Torch.

- It includes lot of loss functions.

- It can be considered as NumPy extension to GPUs.

- It allows building networks whose structure is dependent on computation itself.
