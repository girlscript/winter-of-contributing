- Linear Regression is supervised machine learning model.
- Linear Regression makes predictions when output variable is continuous in nature.
- It shows a linear relation between dependent variable and independent variables.

**Types of linear regression:**

- Simple linear regression:
 
 Linear regression is known as simple linear regression when single input are present.
  
- Multiple linear regression:
 
 Linear regression is known as multiple linear regression when two or more nputs are present in the dataset.


- Equation of simple linear regression:
Y = a + bX

- Equation of multiple linear regression:
Y = a + bX1 + cX2+……

**How to measure linear regression?**

*Error functions and accuracy functions:*

- Mean error.
- Mean absolute error.
- Mean square error.
- Root mean square error.
- Mean percentage error.
- Mean absolute percentage error.

**Assumptions for best fit of linear regression:**

The line should not pose Multi-collinearity, Homoscedasticity, Auto-correlation.


**Advantages:**

- Easy to implement when we have a linear relationship in the dataset.
- Easy to interpret the output coefficient.

**Disadvantages:**

- Outliers have a huge effect on the model performance.
- It does not give a complete description of relationship between variables.
