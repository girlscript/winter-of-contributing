- Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning model.
- Linear Regression makes predictions when the output variable is continuous in nature.
- It shows a linear relationship between a dependent variables and independent variables.

**Types of linear regression:**
 
- Simple linear regression:
 
 Linear regression is known as simple linear regression when single inputs are present.
  
- Multiple linear regression:
 
 Linear regression is known as multiple linear regression when two or more inputs are present in the dataset.
 
 
- Equation of simple linear regression:
Y = a + bX
 
- Equation of multiple linear regression:
Y = a + bX1 + cX2+……
 
**How to measure linear regression?**
 
*Error functions and accuracy functions:*
 
- Mean error.
- Mean absolute error.
- Mean square error.
- Root mean square error.
- Mean percentage error.
- Mean absolute percentage error.
 
**Assumptions for best fit of linear regression:**
 
The line should not pose Multi-collinearity, Homoscedasticity, Auto-correlation.
 
 
**Advantages:**
 
- Easy to implement when we have a linear relationship in the dataset.
- Easy to interpret the output coefficient.
 
**Disadvantages:**
 
- Outliers have a huge effect on the model performance.
- It does not give a complete description of the relationship between variables.
