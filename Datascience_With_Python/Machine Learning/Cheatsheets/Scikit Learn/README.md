# ðŸ˜· What is scikit-learn ?  
scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See the About us page for a list of core contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.
