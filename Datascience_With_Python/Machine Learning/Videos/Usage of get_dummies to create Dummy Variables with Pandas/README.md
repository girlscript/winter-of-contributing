**What is the purpose of dummy variables?**

Dummy Variables. The main purpose of “dummy variables” is that they are tools that allow us to represent nominal-level independent variables in statistical techniques like regression analysis.

- Conversation of categorical data to numeric data.

- Many of the model in data mining treats or computes the dataset when all the datatype is in numeric.

- Methods that are used to convert:

- Label encoder: Label Encoding refers to converting the labels into a numeric form so as to convert them
into the machine-readable form.

- One- hot encoding: A one hot encoding is a representation of categorical variables as binary vectors. 
This first requires that the categorical values be mapped to integer values.
