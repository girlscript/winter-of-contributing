# Introduction

# What is Breast Cancer?
Breast cancer could be a disease within which cells within the breast grow out of control. There are different varieties of carcinoma.<br>The type of carcinoma depends on which cells within the breast grow to be cancer.<br>
Breast cancer can begin in numerous parts of the breast.A breast is formed from three main parts: lobules, ducts, and connective tissue.

# How is the prediction Done?
In this study, we predict Breast Cancer by using 6 algorithms:<br>
1. Logistic regression classification
2. SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification
3. Naive bayes classification
4. Decision tree classification
5. Random forest classification
6. K-Nearest Neighbor classification

# Steps to be Followed
1. Importing Necessary Libraries.
2. Load the Dataset.
3. Visualize the data.
4. Split the data frame into train and test data frames.<br> For this study using a sample size of 20%, assumed it ideal ratio between training and testing. 
5. Train 6 models using the training data.<br>
We measure the study of 6 different algorithms using a confusion matrix. 
6. Compare the Classification Techniques. 
7. Plotting the ROC Curve-plot the ROC curve to illustrate the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.

# Advantages of Breast Cancer Prediction
* Reduces the danger of dying from breast cancer.
* Reduces the danger of getting to undergo chemotherapy.
* Allows women to understand the health of their breasts

# Accuracies gained by these models
1. Logistic Regression Score       0.921053
2.  Support Vector Machine Score    0.894737
3. Naive Bayes Score               0.903509
4. Decision Tree Score             0.868421
5. Random Forest Score             0.921053
6. K-Nearest Neighbour Score       0.894737

# Conclusion
From the study, we conclude that the machine learning techniques are able to detect the disease automatically with high accuracy.
