- Machine learning applications provide analytics and insights gleaned from available data which contribute to actionable decision-making in businesses. Since machine learning revolves around studying and implementing algorithms, it is important to bolster your mathematical skills. 
- It helps in eliminating uncertainty and predicting data values accurately where complex data parameters and features are involved. It also aids us in better understanding the Bias-Variance trade-off. 

- Mastering machine learning requires knowledge of mathematical concepts like linear algebra, vector calculus, analytical geometry, matrix decompositions, probability and statistics. A strong grasp of these helps in creating intuitive machine learning applications. 

## Linear Algebra
- Linear Algebra is concerned with vectors and matrices, and mostly revolves around computation. It plays an integral role in machine learning and deep learning techniques. According to Skyler Speakman, it is the mathematics of the 21st century. 

- Linear Algebra is typically used by ML engineers and data scientists or researchers to build Linear algorithms, Logistic regressions, Decision trees, and Support Vector Machines.

## Calculus 
- Calculus drives machine learning algorithms. Without knowledge of its concepts, it wouldn’t be possible to predict outcomes using a given data set. Calculus helps to analyze the rate at which quantities change, and is concerned with the optimum performance of machine learning algorithms.
-  Integrations, differentials, limits, and derivatives are a few concepts of calculus that help train deep Neural Networks. 

## Probability
- Probability in machine learning predicts the set of outcomes whereas statistics drive the favourable outcome to its conclusion. The event could be as simple as tossing a coin. Probability can be broken down into two categories: Conditional Probability and Joint Probability. 
- Joint probability happens when the events are independent of each other, whereas conditional probability occurs when one event supersedes the other. 

## Statistics
- Statistics focuses on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the algorithm. It helps us to identify goals and transform collected data into precise observations by presenting it concisely. Statistics in machine learning focuses on Descriptive statistics and Inferential statistics. 

- Descriptive statistics is concerned with describing and summarizing the small dataset a model is working on. The methods used here are mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variation. The end results are presented as pictorial representations.

- Inferential statistics deals with extracting insights from a given sample while working with a large dataset. Inferential statistics allow machines to analyse data beyond the scope of the provided information. Hypothesis tests, sampling distributions, analysis of variance, are some aspects of Inferential Statistics.

- Apart from these, coding prowess is a crucial prerequisite for Machine learning. Expertise in languages such as Python and Java help in a better understanding of data modelling. String formatting, defining functions, loops with multiple variable iterators, if or else conditional expressions are some of its basic functions. 

- As for data modelling, it is the process through which we estimate the structure of data sets and detect possible variations and patterns. To be able to make accurate predictions, one must be aware of the various properties of the collective data. 

## Future Scope of Machine Learning
- Even though machine learning has been around for decades, it’s application is most apparent today. The industry has yet to prosper, and improvise, which implies that the future of machine learning is bright. Most large-scale companies are already reaping the benefits of machine learning and scaling their services and products to drive growth.

- Naturally, ML engineers are in heavy demand and machine learning presents itself as a lucrative career to get into. It stands to businesses the edge they need. AI has generated an estimated 2.3 million job opportunities until now. It’s been projected that, by the end of 2022, the global ML industry will grow at a CAGR of 42.2% to reach USD 9 billion.

## Conclusion 

The topics such as calculus, analytical geometry, matrix decompositions,statistics, probability and linear algebra are the key concepts for ML.
