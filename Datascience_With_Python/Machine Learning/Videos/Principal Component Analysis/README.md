## Dimension Reduction:
- Dimension Reduction is used to reduce the dimensions of the dataset.

**Types of dimension reduction:**
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
- PCA is a statistical method that is used to convert a set of correlated variables to a set of uncorrelated variables.
- It is an unsupervised machine learning model.
- Broadly, used as an EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) method.

**It Used to convert large number of features into a fewer features with some loss of information:**
- Identify the relationship between columns.
- Visualize the multivariate data using 2 Principal Components.
- It will help condense the features.

**When/Why to use PCA:**
- PCA technique is particularly useful in processing data where multicollinearity exists between the features/variables. 
- PCA can be used when the dimensions of the input features are high (e.g. a lot of variables).
- PCA can be also used for denoising and data compression. 

**Some of the Applications of PCA:**
- Computation is fast. 
- Image compression.
