## Random Forest Algorithm 
## [Click here to see the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r2bgD7P64UGbLCcItpYMU3h18PTetmpd/view?usp=sharing)
- It is a supervised learning model.
- It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems.
- It is based on the concept ofÂ ensemble learning.
- Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.
- The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting.

**Two assumptions for a better Random forest classifier:**
- There should be some actual values in the feature variable of the dataset so that the classifier can predict accurate results rather than a guessed result.
- The predictions from each tree must have very low correlations.

**Why use Random Forest?**
- Less training time.
- Predicts output with high accuracy.
- It runs efficiently.
- It works well when data is missing.
- In order to prevent the overfitting, we use random forest model.

**How does it works:**
- It builds the decision tree and when new data point is added it assigns the categories 
which has the maximum votes.
- A decision tree is build on decisions or conditions.
- It builds various decisions tress.
- When new data point is added it assigns the categories which has the maximum votes.

**Advantages:**
- It is capable of performing both Classification and Regression tasks.
- It performs well even if data is missing.
- It enhances the accuracy of the model.
- Prevents the overfitting issue.

**Disadvantages:**
- Although random forest can be used for both classification and regression tasks, it is not more suitable for Regression tasks.
