- Logistic Regression is supervised machine learning techniques.

- Logistic Regression makes predictions when output variable is discrete or categorical in nature.
- It shows a sigmoid relation between dependent variable and independent variables.
- Equation:

**Types of logistic regression:**
- Simple logistic regression: When single input and single output is present, it is known as simple logistic regression.
- Multiple logistic regression: When more than two  inputs and single output is present, it is known as multiple logistic regression.
- Equation of simple logistic regression:

**How to measure logistic regression?**

*Error functions and accuracy functions:*

• Mean error.

• Mean absolute error.

• Mean square error.

• Root mean square error.

• Mean percentage error.

• Mean absolute percentage error.

**Assumptions for best fit of logistic regression:**
- The line should not pose the following properties:
  • Multi-collinearity.

  • Homoscedasticity.

  • Normal distribution of errors.

  • Auto-correlation.

**The Differences between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression:**
- Linear Regression is used to handle regression problems whereas Logistic regression is used to handle the 
classification problems.
- Linear regression provides a continuous output but Logistic regression provides discrete output.
- The purpose of Linear Regression is to find the best-fitted line while Logistic regression is one step ahead and 
fitting the line values to the sigmoid curve.
- The method for calculating loss function in linear regression is the mean squared error whereas for logistic 
regression it is maximum likelihood estimation
