- Polynomial Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm.

- It is the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables as nth degree 
polynomial. 

- Equation:

  y= b0+b1x1+ b2x12+ b2x13+...... bnx1n

## Why do we use Polynomial regression?

- Polynomial regression is a special type of multiple linear regression.

- Multiple linear regression is converted to polynomial regression by adding the polynomial terms to the linear equation.

- It is a linear model with some modification in order to increase the accuracy.

- When data points are arranged in a non-linear fashion, we need the Polynomial Regression model.

## How Does it Work?

Python has methods for finding a relationship between data-points and to draw a line of polynomial regression. We will show you how to use these methods instead of going through the mathematic formula.

## Advantages:
- Model accuracy increases.

- For non-linear data points we can draw the best fit line.

## Disadvantages:
- Model complexity increases.

- Training time increases.

- In some cases, it might lead to overfitting for the data values.

## Conclusion:
To conclude, Polynomial Regression is utilized in many situations where there is a non-linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Though this algorithm suffers from sensitivity towards outliers, it can be corrected by treating them before fitting the regression line.
