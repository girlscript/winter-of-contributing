**Polynomial Regression**

- Polynomial Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm.

- It is the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables as nth degree 
  polynomial. 

- Equation:
  y= b0+b1x1+ b2x12+ b2x13+...... bnx1n

**Why do we use Polynomial regression?**

- Polynomial regression is a special type of multiple linear regression.

- Multiple linear regression is converted to polynomial regression by adding the polynomial terms to the linear equation.

- It is a linear model with some modification in order to increase the accuracy.

- When data points are arranged in a non-linear fashion, we need the Polynomial Regression model.

**Advantages:**
- Model accuracy increases.

- For non-linear data points we can draw the best fit line.

**Disadvantages:**
- Model complexity increases.

- Training time increases.

- In some cases, it might lead to overfitting for the data values.
