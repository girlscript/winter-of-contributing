Variance analysis can be summarized as an analysis of the difference between planned and actual numbers. The sum of all variances gives a picture of the overall over-performance or under-performance for a particular reporting period. For each item, companies assess their favorability by comparing actual costs to standard costs in the industry.

## The Role of Variance Analysis
When standards are compared to actual performance numbers, the difference is what we call a “variance.” Variances are computed for both the price and quantity of materials, labor, and variable overhead, and are reported to management. However, not all variances are important.

Management should only pay attention to those that are unusual or particularly significant. Often, by analyzing these variances, companies are able to use the information to identify a problem so that it can be fixed or simply to improve overall company performance.

## What happens when we have variance zero or near zero?
- Generally, columns or data values having variance zero or near near are avoided as there would not be any use in building the models on these data values or columns.

## Advantages of Variance analysis
1. The reasons for the overall variances can be easily found
 for remedial action.
2. The sub-division of variance analysis discloses the relationship prevailing between different variances.
3. It is highly useful for fixing responsibility of an individual or department or section for each variance separately.
4. It highlights all inefficient performances and the extent of inefficiency.
5. It is used for cost control.

## The Limitations Of Variance Analysis
The process of variance analysis, while useful, may not be for every company. While it can be highly beneficial for companies to use variance analysis, they must also understand the limitations that they will face. These are as below.
- Lengthy Process
- Costly Process
- Subjective Interpretation
- Limited Scope

## Conclusion
Variance analysis is a tool that companies use to compared budgeted and actual performances. Variance analysis is significantly critical for companies to monitor and control their costs. Similarly, it can help in decision-making as well.

Variance analysis is used to assess the price and quantity of materials, labour and overhead costs. These numbers are reported to management. ... In this way, management can rely on variance analysis to help to improve the company's overall performance or process improvement protocol
