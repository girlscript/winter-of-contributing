## What Is the Correlation Coefficient?
- The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of the relationship between the relative movements of two variables. The values range between -1.0 and 1.0. A calculated number greater than 1.0 or less than -1.0 means that there was an error in the correlation measurement. 
- A correlation of -1.0 shows a perfect negative correlation, while a correlation of 1.0 shows a perfect positive correlation. A correlation of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the movement of the two variables.


- Correlation statistics can be used in finance and investing. For example, a correlation coefficient could be calculated to determine the level of correlation between the price of crude oil and the stock price of an oil-producing company, such as Exxon Mobil Corporation. Since oil companies earn greater profits as oil prices rise, the correlation between the two variables is highly positive.




# Types of Correlation coefficients

In this tutorial, you’ll learn about three correlation coefficients:<br>

1. Pearson correlation coefficient : Pearson correlation coefficient or Pearson’s correlation coefficient or Pearson’s r is defined in statistics as the measurement of the strength of the relationship between two variables and their association with each other.<br>
The Pearson coefficient correlation has a excessive statistical significance. It appears at the connection among variables. It seeks to draw a line via the data of variables to expose their relationship. The relationship of the variables is measured with the assist Pearson coefficient of correlation calculator. This linear relationship may be positive or negative.

2.Spearman’s correlation coefficient : Spearman’s correlation coefficient is a statistical degree of the power of a monotonic relationship amongnst paired data. The Spearman rank correlation check does now not convey any assumptions about the distribution of the facts and is the precise correlation evaluation on the identical time because the variables are measured on a scale this is at the least ordinal.<br>

3.Kendall rank correlation coefficient : In statistics, the Kendall rank correlation coefficient, usually called Kendall's τ coefficient, is a statistic used to degree the ordinal affiliation among measured quantities.<br>
It is taken into consideration a nonparametric opportunity to the Pearson’s product-moment correlation whilst your data has failed one or extra of the assumptions of this test.<br>

## Correlation Coefficient Equation
To calculate the Pearson product-moment correlation, one must first determine the covariance of the two variables in question. Next, one must calculate each variable's standard deviation. The correlation coefficient is determined by dividing the covariance by the product of the two variables' standard deviations.

## Conclusion 

- Correlation coefficients are used to measure the strength of the relationship between two variables.
- Pearson correlation is the one most commonly used in statistics. This measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.
- Values always range between -1 (strong negative relationship) and +1 (strong positive relationship). Values at or close to zero imply a weak or no linear relationship.
- Correlation coefficient values less than +0.8 or greater than -0.8 are not considered significant.
