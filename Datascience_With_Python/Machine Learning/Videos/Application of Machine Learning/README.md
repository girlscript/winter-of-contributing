- Image Recognition:
     - Image recognition is one of the most common applications of machine learning. 
     - It is used to identify objects, persons, places, digital images, etc. 
- Speech Recognition
     - While using Google, we get an option of "Search by voice," it comes under speech recognition, and it's a popular application of machine learning.
     - Speech recognition is a process of converting voice instructions into text, and it is also known as "Speech to text", or "Computer speech recognition." 
- Traffic prediction:
     - If we want to visit a new place, we take help of Google Maps, which shows us the correct path with the shortest route and predicts the traffic conditions.
     - Everyone who is using Google Map is helping this app to make it better. It takes information from the user and sends back to its database to improve the performance.
- Product recommendations:
     - Machine learning is widely used by various e-commerce and entertainment companies such as Amazon, Netflix, etc., for product recommendation to the user. 
     - Whenever we search for some product on Amazon, then we started getting an advertisement for the same product while internet surfing on the same browser and this is
      because of machine learning.
- Self-driving cars:
     - One of the most exciting applications of machine learning is self-driving cars. 
     - Machine learning plays a significant role in self-driving cars.

- Email Spam and Malware Filtering:
     - Below are some spam filters used by Gmail:
         - Content Filter
         - Header filter
         - General blacklists filter
         - Rules-based filters
         - Permission filters
     - Some machine learning algorithms such as Multi-Layer Perceptron, Decision tree, and Na√Øve Bayes classifier are used for email spam filtering and malware detection.
- Stock Market trading:
     - Machine learning is widely used in stock market trading. 
     - In the stock market, there is always a risk of up and downs in shares, so for this machine learning's long short term memory neural network is used for the prediction of stock market trends.
- Medical Diagnosis:
     - In medical science, machine learning is used for diseases diagnoses. 
     - With this, medical technology is growing very fast and able to build 3D models that can predict the exact position of lesions in the brain.

**Overview:**
- Machine learning is a buzzword for today's technology, and it is growing very rapidly day by day.
- We are using machine learning in our daily life even without knowing it such as Google Maps, Google assistant, Alexa, etc.
