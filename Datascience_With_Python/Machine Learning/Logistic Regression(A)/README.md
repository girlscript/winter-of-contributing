Contribution Approaches- **Logistic Regression**
Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. 
Mathematically, a logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X.
It can be used for various classification problems such as spam detection, Diabetes prediction, cancer detection etc.

**Types Of Logistic Regression **
Binary or Binomial - A dependent variable will have only two possible types either 1 and 0.
Multinomial -  A dependent variable can have 3 or more possible unordered types or the types having no quantitative significance.
Ordinal - A dependent variable can have 3 or more possible ordered types or the types having a quantitative significance.

**Logistic Function**
The logistic function, also called the sigmoid function.  Itâ€™s an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits.
Sigmoid = 1 / (1 + e^-value)    ,Where e is the base of the natural logarithms 

**ASSUMPTIONS FOR LOGISTIC REGRESSION**
The dependent variable must be categorical in nature.
The independent variable should not have multicollinearity.

**LOGISTIC REGRESSION EQUATION**
The Logistic regression equation can be obtained from the Linear Regression equation. The equation is as follows: -
