# Ensemble Learning Methods

# Description

The idea of ensemble learning is closely related to the idea of the “wisdom of crowds“. This is where many different independent decisions, choices or estimates are combined into a final outcome that is often more accurate than any single contribution.

Ensemble Learning Methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone.
