## Variance Analysis
- Variance Analysis is the analysis between predicted and actual data values.
- The sum of all variances gives a conclusion whether a model is over-performanced or under-performanced.

## The Role of Variance Analysis
- Variance is a measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set.
- Investors use variance to see how much risk an investment carries and whether it will be profitable.
- Variance is also used to compare the relative performance of each asset in a portfolio to achieve the best asset allocation.

## What happens when we have variance zero or near zero?
- Generally, columns or data values having variance zero or near near are avoided as there would not be any use in building the models on these data values or columns.

## Advantages of Variance analysis
1. The reasons for the overall variances can be easily found
 for remedial action.
2. The sub-division of variance analysis discloses the relationship prevailing between different variances.
3. It is highly useful for fixing responsibility of an individual or department or section for each variance separately.
4. It highlights all inefficient performances and the extent of inefficiency.
5. It is used for cost control.

## The Limitations Of Variance Analysis
The process of variance analysis, while useful, may not be for every company. While it can be highly beneficial for companies to use variance analysis, they must also understand the limitations that they will face. These are as below.
- Lengthy Process
- Costly Process
- Subjective Interpretation
- Limited Scope

## Conclusion
Variance analysis is a tool that companies use to compared budgeted and actual performances. Variance analysis is significantly critical for companies to monitor and control their costs. Similarly, it can help in decision-making as well.
