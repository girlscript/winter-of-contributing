# Factors to consider for model selection

One of the biggest revolutions that happened in the past 20 odd years can be the massive and unprecedented growth of the processing capabilities of computers due to the advancement in hardware. The eventual result of this was the humongous amount of data that began to generate daily. 
As the size of the data increased, so did the methods of handling them. Right now, the data and its related problems are business/domain-specific. The most common methods of solving data-driven problems include deploying the knowledge of Machine and Artificial Learning to gain meaningful insights, patterns, and predictions.

However, as there is a range of business problems, there is also a range of algorithms that can be used, making it important to understand the relationship between the algorithms and the various kinds of business problems which helps in choosing the right algorithm leading to better results.
