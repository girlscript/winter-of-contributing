# **Data Cleaning**

## **Introduction**

While working on a Machine Learning & Data Science project, we might come across an unbalanced data i.e. have null data values or  missing data values or any inappropriate data values etc. 
- So, it becomes important to balance the data before moving to Data Creation & Model creation steps.
-This tutorial will help understand how to clean such data and improve performance of the project.

## **Purpose**

The main prupose is to give a clear understanding ondata cleaning in a dataset, how it's done, usage, libaries used etc.

## **Brief Explanation**

This tutorial will help understand how to clean such data and improve performance of the project.


Here, with a sample dataset let's understand how to clean the data by following steps:

-  Data preprocessing and exploration to understand what kind of data will we working on.
-  Data Preparation which will include data cleaning whichin we will be finding all null data values and clean them.
