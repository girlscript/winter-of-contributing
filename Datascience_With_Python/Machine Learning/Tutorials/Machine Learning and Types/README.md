# Machine Learning

“Machine Learning is defined as the study of computer programs that leverage algorithms and statistical models to learn
through inference and patterns without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning field has undergone significant
developments in the last decade.”

Machine Learning (ML) has proven to be one of the most game-changing technological advancements of the past decade. In
the increasingly competitive corporate world, ML is enabling companies to fast-track digital transformation and move
into an age of automation. Some might even argue that AI/ML is required to stay relevant in some verticals, such as
digital payments and fraud detection in banking or product recommendations . The eventual adoption of machine learning
algorithms and its pervasiveness in enterprises is also well-documented, with different companies adopting machine
learning at scale across verticals.

Today, every other app and software all over the Internet uses machine learning in some form or the other. Machine
Learning has become so pervasive that it has now become the go-to way for companies to solve a bevy of problems.

# What is Artificial Intelligence?

To understand what machine learning is, we must first look at the basic concepts of artificial intelligence (AI). AI is
defined as a program that exhibits cognitive ability similar to that of a human being. Making computers think like
humans and solve problems the way we do is one of the main tenets of artificial intelligence. AI exists as an umbrella
term that is used to denote all computer programs that can think as humans do. Any computer program that shows
characteristics, such as self-improvement, learning through inference, or even basic human tasks, such as image
recognition and language processing, is considered to be a form of AI. The field of artificial intelligence includes
within it the sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning. Deep Learning is a more specialized version of machine
learning that utilizes more complex methods for difficult problems. One thing to note, however, is the difference
between machine learning and artificial intelligence. While machine learning is probabilistic (output can be explained,
thereby ruling out the black box nature of AI), deep learning is deterministic. The process of self-learning by
collecting new data on the problem has allowed machine learning algorithms to take over the corporate space.

# What is Machine Learning?

With machine learning algorithms, AI was able to develop beyond just performing the tasks it was programmed to do.
Before ML entered the
mainstream, AI programs were only used to automate low-level tasks in business and enterprise settings. This included
tasks like intelligent automation or simple rule-based classification. This meant that AI algorithms were restricted to
only the domain of what they were processed for. However, with machine learning, computers were able to move past doing
what they were programmed and began evolving with each iteration. Machine learning is fundamentally set apart from
artificial intelligence, as it has the capability to evolve. Using various programming techniques, machine learning
algorithms are able to process large amounts of data and extract useful information. In this way, they can improve upon
their previous iterations by learning from the data they are provided. We cannot talk about machine learning without
speaking about big data, one of the most important aspects of machine learning algorithms. Any type of AI is usually
dependent on the quality of its dataset for good results, as the field makes use of statistical methods heavily. Machine
learning is no exception, and a good flow of organized, varied data is required for a robust ML solution. In today’s
online-first world, companies have access to a large amount of data about their customers, usually in the millions. This
data, which is both large in the number of data points and the number of fields, is known as big data due to the sheer
amount of information it holds. Big data is time-consuming and difficult to process by human standards, but good quality
data is the best fodder to train a machine learning algorithm. The more clean, usable, and machine-readable data there
is in a big dataset, the more effective the training of the machine learning algorithm will be. As explained, machine
learning algorithms have the ability to improve themselves through training. Today, ML algorithms are trained using
three prominent methods. These are three types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and
reinforcement learning.


# Artificial Intelligence Vs. Machine Learning 

As American professor Douglas Hofstadter quotes, “AI is whatever hasn’t been done yet.” This is
referred to as the AI Effect, wherein new techniques not only obsolete previous ones but also make the latter much more
accessible and optimized for use. By this logic, artificial intelligence refers to any advancement in the field of
cognitive computers, with machine learning being a subset of AI. Today, the term ‘artificial intelligence’ has been used
as more of an umbrella term to denote technology that exhibits human-like cognitive characteristics. As a rule of thumb,
research in AI is moving towards a more generalized form of intelligence, similar to the way toddlers think and perceive
the world around them. This could mark the evolution of AI from a program purpose-built for a single ‘narrow’ task to a
solution deployed for ‘general’ solutions; the kind we can expect from humans. Machine learning, on the other hand, is
an exclusive subset of AI reserved only for algorithms that can dynamically improve on themselves. They are not
statically programmed for one task like many AI programs are, and can be improved even after they are deployed. This not
only makes them suitable for enterprise applications, but it is also a novel way to solve problems in an always-changing
environment. Machine learning also includes deep learning, a specialized discipline that holds the key to the future of
AI. Deep learning features neural networks, a type of algorithm that is based on the physical structure of the human
brain. Neural networks seem to be the most productive path forward for AI research, as it allows for a much closer
emulation of the human brain than has ever been seen before.

</p>

As with any method, there are different ways to train machine learning algorithms, each with their own advantages and
disadvantages. To understand the pros and cons of each type of machine learning, we must first look at what kind of data
they ingest. In ML, there are two kinds of data — labeled data and unlabeled data. Labeled data has both the input and
output parameters in a completely machine-readable pattern, but requires a lot of human labor to label the data, to
begin with. Unlabeled data only has one or none of the parameters in a machine-readable form. This negates the need for
human labor but requires more complex solutions. There are also some types of machine learning algorithms that are used
in very specific use-cases, but three main methods are used today.

## Supervised Learning

> Supervised learning is one of the most basic types of machine learning. In this type, the machine learning algorithm is
trained on labeled data. Even though the data needs to be labeled accurately for this method to work, supervised learning is extremely powerful when
used in the right circumstances. In supervised learning, the ML algorithm is given a small training dataset to work
with. This training dataset is a smaller part of the bigger dataset and serves to give the algorithm a basic idea of the
problem, solution, and data points to be dealt with. The training dataset is also very similar to the final dataset in
its characteristics and provides the algorithm with the labeled parameters required for the problem. The algorithm then
finds relationships between the parameters given, essentially establishing a cause and effect relationship between the
variables in the dataset. At the end of the training, the algorithm has an idea of how the data works and the
relationship between the input and the output. This solution is then deployed for use with the final dataset, which it
learns from in the same way as the training dataset. This means that supervised machine learning algorithms will
continue to improve even after being deployed, discovering new patterns and relationships as it trains itself on new
data.

> In Supervised Learning, a machine is trained using ‘labeled’ data. Datasets are said to be labeled when they contain
both input and output parameters. In other words, the data has already been tagged with the correct answer.

> So, the technique mimics a classroom environment where a student learns in the presence of a supervisor or teacher. On
the other hand, unsupervised learning algorithms let the models discover information and learn on their own.

> Supervised machine learning is immensely helpful in solving real-world computational problems. The algorithm predicts
outcomes for unforeseen data by learning from labeled training data. Therefore, it takes highly-skilled data scientists
to build and deploy such models. Over time, data scientists also use their technical expertise to rebuild the models to
maintain the integrity of the insights given.


### How Does it Work?

> For instance, you want to train a machine in predicting your commute time between your office and home. First, you would
create a labeled data set such as the weather, time of day, chosen route, etc. which would comprise your input data. And
the output would be the estimated duration of your journey back home on a specific day.
Once you create a training set is based on corresponding factors, the machine would see the relationships between data
points and use it to ascertain the amount of time it will take for you to drive back home. For example, a mobile
application can tell you that your travel time will be longer when there’s heavy rainfall.
The machine may also see other connections in your labeled data, like the time you leave from work. You can reach home
earlier if you start before the rush hour traffic hits the roads. Read more if you are curious to know about how
unsupervised machine learning works.

> Now, let us try to understand supervised learning with the help of another real-life example. Suppose you have a fruit
basket, and you train the machine with all different kinds of fruits. Training data may include these scenarios:

> If the object is red in color, round in shape, and has a depression on its top, label it as ‘Apple’
If the item has a greenish-yellow color and shaped like a curved cylinder, mark it as ‘Banana’
Next, you give a new object (test data) and ask the machine to identify whether it is a banana or an apple. It will
learn from the training data and apply the knowledge to classify the fruit according to the inputted colours and shapes.

### Different Types of Supervised Learning

**1. Regression**

    In regression, a single output value is produced using training data. This value is a probabilistic interpretation,
    which is ascertained after considering the strength of correlation among the input variables. For example, regression
    can help predict the price of a house based on its locality, size, etc.

    In logistic regression, the output has discrete values based on a set of independent variables. This method can flounder
    when dealing with non-linear and multiple decision boundaries. Also, it is not flexible enough to capture complex
    relationships in datasets.

</p>


**2. Classification**

    It involves grouping the data into classes. If you are thinking of extending credit to a person, you can use
    classification to determine whether or not a person would be a loan defaulter. When the supervised learning algorithm
    labels input data into two distinct classes, it is called binary classification. Multiple classifications means
    categorizing data into more than two classes.

**3. Naive Bayesian Model**

    The Bayesian model of classification is used for large finite datasets. It is a method of assigning class labels using a
    direct acyclic graph. The graph comprises one parent node and multiple children nodes. And each child node is assumed to
    be independent and separate from the parent.

**4. Decision Trees**

    A decision tree is a flowchart-like model that contains conditional control statements, comprising decisions and their
    probable consequences. The output relates to the labelling of unforeseen data.

    In the tree representation, the leaf nodes correspond to class labels, and the internal nodes represent the attributes.
    A decision tree can be used to solve problems with discrete attributes as well as boolean functions. Some of the notable
    decision tree algorithms are ID3 and CART.

</p>

**5. Random Forest Model**

    The random forest model is an ensemble method. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees and outputs a
    classification of the individual trees. Suppose you want to predict which undergraduate students will perform well in
    GMAT – a test taken for admission into graduate management programs. A random forest model would accomplish the task,
    given the demographic and educational factors of a set of students who have previously taken the test.

</p>

**6. Neural Networks**

    This algorithm is designed to cluster raw input, recognize patterns, or interpret sensory data. Despite their multiple
    advantages, neural networks require significant computational resources. It can get complicated to fit a neural network
    when there are thousands of observations. It is also called the ‘black-box’ algorithm as interpreting the logic behind
    their predictions can be challenging.

**7. Support Vector Machines**

    Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm developed in the year 1990. It draws from the
    statistical learning theory developed by Vap Nick.

    SVM separates hyperplanes, which makes it a discriminative classifier. The output is produced in the form of an optimal
    hyperplane that categorizes new examples. SVMs are closely connected to the kernel framework and used in diverse fields.
    Some examples include bioinformatics, pattern recognition, and multimedia information retrieval.

### Pros & Cons of Supervised Learning

    Several types of supervised learning allow you to collect and produce data from previous experience. From optimizing
    performance criteria to dealing with real-world problems, supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool in the AI
    field. It is also a more trustworthy method as compared to unsupervised learning, which can be computationally complex
    and less accurate in some instances.

    However, supervised learning is not without its limitations. Concrete examples are required for training classifiers,
    and decision boundaries can be overtrained in the absence of the right examples. One may also encounter difficulty in
    classifying big data.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning refers to the training of an AI system using information that is not classified or labelled. What this ideally means is that the algorithm has to act on the information without any prior guidance.
In unsupervised learning, the machine groups unsorted/unordered information regarding similarities and differences. This is done without the provision of categories for the machine to categorize the data into.  The systems that use such learning are generally associated with generative learning model.

### How does Unsupervised Machine Learning work?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57637086/139263178-06ffe356-e7bc-4831-9b87-fe8d186ff20a.png)


In unsupervised learning, an AI system is presented with unlabeled, uncategorized data and the system’s algorithms act on the data without prior training. The output is dependent upon the coded algorithms. Subjecting a system to unsupervised learning is an established way of testing the capabilities of that system.
Unsupervised learning algorithms can perform more complex processing tasks than supervised learning systems. However, unsupervised learning can be more unpredictable than the alternate model. A system trained using the unsupervised model, might,  for example, figure out on its own how to differentiate cats and dogs, it might also add unexpected and undesired categories to deal with unusual breeds, which might end up cluttering things instead of keeping them in order.

For unsupervised learning algorithms, the AI system is presented with an unlabeled and uncategorized data set. The thing to keep in mind is that this system has not undergone any prior training. In essence, unsupervised learning can be thought of as learning without a teacher.
In case of supervised learning, the system has both the inputs and the outputs. So depending on the difference between the desired output and the observed output, the system is set to learn and improve. However, in the case of unsupervised learning, the system only has inputs and no outputs.
What is Machine Learning and Why it matters
Unsupervised learning comes in extremely helpful during the tasks associated with data mining and feature extraction. The ultimate goal of unsupervised learning is to discover hidden trends and patterns in the data or to extract desired features. Like we said earlier, unsupervised learning only deals with the input data set without any prior knowledge or learning. Therefore, there are two types of unsupervised learning:

### Parametric Unsupervised Learning

    Parametric unsupervised learning assumes a parametric distribution of data. What this means, is that this type of
    unsupervised learning assumes that the data comes from a population that follows a particular probability distribution
    based on some parameters. In theory, if we consider a normal distribution of a family of objects, then we’ll see that
    all the members have some similar characteristic and are always parametrized by mean and standard deviation. This means
    that if we know the mean and standard deviation, and if the distribution is normal, then we can very easily find out the
    probability of future observations. Parametric Unsupervised Learning is much harder than the standard supervised
    learning because there are no labels available; hence there is no predefined measure of accuracy to test the output.

### Non-parametric Unsupervised Learning

    Non-parametric unsupervised learning refers to the clustering of the input data set. Each cluster, in essence, says
    something about the categories and classes of the data items present in the set. This is the most commonly used method
    for data modelling and analyzing data with small sample sizes. These methods are also referred to as distribution-free
    methods because unlike in the case of parametric learning, the modeller doesn’t need to make any assumptions about the
    distribution of the whole population.These 6 Machine Learning Techniques are Improving HealthcareAt this point, it is
    essential to dive a bit into what do we mean by clustering.

**So, what is clustering?**

    Clustering is one of the most important underlying concepts when it comes to unsupervised learning. It deals with
    finding a structure or pattern in a collection of uncategorized data. A simple definition of a cluster could be “the
    process of grouping the object into classes such that each member of a class is similar to the other in one or the other
    way.”
    Therefore, a cluster can be simply defined as a collection of data objects which are “similar” between a cluster and
    “dissimilar” to the objects of the other cluster.

### Applications of unsupervised machine learning

    The goal of unsupervised machine learning is to uncover previously hidden patterns and trends in the data. But, most of
    the time, the data patterns are poor approximations of what supervised machine learning can achieve – for example, they
    segment customers into large groups, rather than treating them as individuals and delivering highly personalized
    communications. In the case of unsupervised learning, we do not know what the outcome will be, and hence, if we need to
    design a predictive model, supervised learning makes more sense in real-world context.
    The ideal use-case for using unsupervised machine learning is when you don’t have data on desired outcomes. For
    instance, if you need to determine a target market for an entirely new product. However, if you want to categorize your
    consumer base better, supervised learning is the better option.
    
## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning directly takes inspiration from how human beings learn from data in their lives. It features an
algorithm that improves upon itself and learns from new situations using a trial-and-error method. Favorable outputs are
encouraged or ‘reinforced’, and non-favorable outputs are discouraged or ‘punished’. Based on the psychological concept
of conditioning, reinforcement learning works by putting the algorithm in a work environment with an interpreter and a
reward system. In every iteration of the algorithm, the output result is given to the interpreter, which decides whether
the outcome is favorable or not. In case of the program finding the correct solution, the interpreter reinforces the
solution by providing a reward to the algorithm. If the outcome is not favorable, the algorithm is forced to reiterate
until it finds a better result. In most cases, the reward system is directly tied to the effectiveness of the result. In
typical reinforcement learning use-cases, such as finding the shortest route between two points on a map, the solution
is not an absolute value. Instead, it takes on a score of effectiveness, expressed in a percentage value. The higher
this percentage value is, the more reward is given to the algorithm. Thus, the program is trained to give the best
possible solution for the best possible reward.

### How does reinforcement learning work?

In reinforcement learning, developers devise a method of rewarding desired behaviors and punishing negative behaviors.
This method assigns positive values to the desired actions to encourage the agent and negative values to undesired
behaviors. This programs the agent to seek long-term and maximum overall reward to achieve an optimal solution.

These long-term goals help prevent the agent from stalling on lesser goals. With time, the agent learns to avoid the
negative and seek the positive. This learning method has been adopted in artificial intelligence (AI) as a way of
directing unsupervised machine learning through rewards and penalties.

### Applications and examples of reinforcement learning

While reinforcement learning has been a topic of much interest in the field of AI, its widespread, real-world adoption
and application remain limited. Noting this, however, research papers abound on theoretical applications, and there have
been some successful use cases.

Due to its generality, RL is widely studied in the following disciplines:

Game theory
Control theory
Operations research
Information theory
Simulation-based optimization
Multi-agent systems
Swarm intelligence
Statistics

# Applications of Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms are used in circumstances where the solution is required to
continue improving post-deployment. The dynamic nature of adaptable machine learning solutions is one of the main
selling points for its adoption by companies and organizations across verticals. Machine learning algorithms and
solutions are versatile and can be used as a substitute for medium-skilled human labor given the right circumstances.
For example, customer service executives in large B2C companies have now been replaced by natural language processing
machine learning algorithms known as chatbots. These chatbots can analyze customer queries and provide support for human
customer support executives or deal with the customers directly. Machine learning algorithms also help to improve user
experience and customization for online platforms. Facebook, Netflix, Google, and Amazon all use recommendation systems
to prevent content glut and provide unique content to individual users based on their likes and dislikes. Facebook
utilizes recommendation engines for its news feed on both Facebook and Instagram, as well as for its advertising
services to find relevant leads. Netflix collects user data and recommends various movies and series based on the
preferences of the user. Google utilizes machine learning to structure its results and for YouTube’s recommendation
system, among many other applications. Amazon uses ML to place relevant products in the user’s field of view, maximizing
conversion rates by recommending products that the user actually wants to buy. However, as ML continues to be applied in
various fields and use-cases, it becomes more important to know the difference between artificial intelligence and
machine learning.
