In other words, it shows that the data is regressed on its past values.\n","\n","* The **“I”** stands for integrated, which means that the data is stationary. Stationary data refers to time-series data that’s been made “stationary” by subtracting the observations from the previous values.\n","\n","* The **“MA”** stands for moving average model, indicating that the forecast or outcome of the model depends linearly on the past values. Also, it means that the errors in forecasting are linear functions of past errors. Note that the moving average models are different from statistical moving averages.\n","\n","# **ARIMA Parameters**\n","\n","Each of the AR, I, and MA components are included in the model as a parameter. The parameters are assigned specific integer values that indicate the type of ARIMA model. A common notation for the ARIMA parameters is shown and explained below:\n","\n","### **ARIMA (p, d, q)**\n","\n","* The parameter **p** is the **number of autoregressive terms or the number of “lag observations.”** It is also called the “lag order,” and it determines the outcome of the model by providing lagged data points.\n","\n","* The parameter **d** is known as the **degree of differencing**. It indicates the number of times the lagged indicators have been subtracted to make the data stationary.\n","\n","* The parameter **q** is the **number of forecast errors*** in the model and is also referred to as the size of the moving average window.\n"," \n","\n","The parameters take the value of integers and must be defined for the model to work. They can also take a value of 0, implying that they will not be used in the model.\n","\n","In such a way, the ARIMA model can be turned into:\n","\n","* **ARMA model (no stationary data, d = 0)**\n","\n","* **AR model (no moving averages or stationary data, just an autoregression on past values, d = 0, q = 0)**\n","\n","* **MA model (a moving average model with no autoregression or stationary data, p = 0, d = 0)**\n"," \n","\n","Therefore, ARIMA models may be defined as:\n","\n","* **ARIMA(1, 0, 0) – known as the first-order autoregressive model.**\n","\n","* **ARIMA(0, 1, 0) – known as the random walk model.**\n","\n","* **ARIMA(1, 1, 0) – known as the differenced first-order autoregressive model, and so on.**\n","\n","## **Differences between Autoregressive and Moving average models**\n","\n","* ARIMA combines autoregressive features with those of moving averages.\n","\n","* An AR(1) autoregressive process, for instance, is one in which the current value is based on the immediately preceding value, while an AR(2) process is one in which the current value is based on the previous two values.\n","\n","* A moving average is a calculation used to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set in order to smooth out the influence of outliers.\n","\n","* As a result of this combination of techniques, ARIMA models can take into account trends, cycles, seasonality, and other non-static types of data when making forecasts\n"," \n","* Once the parameters (p, d, q) have been defined, the ARIMA model aims to estimate the coefficients α and θ, which is the result of using previous data points to forecast values.\n","\n","\n"," \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vnDVyrNSretM"},"source":["# **EXAMPLE :**\n","\n","# **ARIMA Model for Time Series Forecasting**\n","\n","\n","## **Components of a Time Series:**\n","\n","### **Trend:** The trend shows a general direction of the time series data over a long period of time. A trend can be increasing(upward), decreasing(downward), or horizontal(stationary).\n","\n","### **Seasonality:** The seasonality component exhibits a trend that repeats with respect to timing, direction, and magnitude. Some examples include an increase in water consumption in summer due to hot weather conditions, or an increase in the number of airline passengers during holidays each year.\n","\n","### **Cyclical Component:** These are the trends with no set repetition over a particular period of time. A cycle refers to the period of ups and downs, booms and slums of a time series, mostly observed in business cycles. These cycles do not exhibit a seasonal variation but generally occur over a time period of 3 to 12 years depending on the nature of the time series.\n","\n","### **Irregular Variation:** These are the fluctuations in the time series data which become evident when trend and cyclical variations are removed. These variations are unpredictable, erratic, and may or may not be random.\n","\n","### **ETS Decomposition:** ETS Decomposition is used to separate different components of a time series.
