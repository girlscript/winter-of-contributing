<h1 align="left">Steps for Machine Learning "MLOps"</h1>


## Brief Summary:
A brief summary of what this entails:

* Machine Learning Pipeline and its steps with example code
* Levels in Mlops

## Description:
# **MLOps:**
> MLOps is a combination of Machine Learning, Data science and DevOps. Many of its principles are borrowed from DevOps. The primary goal of MLOps is to create automated ML pipelines which are used for multiple iterations in the whole lifecycle of the ML project and also to track the other metrics.

# **DevOps:**
>A software can run properly only if it is built correctly. DevOps help in smoothing the whole software development process. DevOps combines the process of Software **Dev**elopment(**Dev**) and Software **Op**eration**s**(**Ops**).
It supports the use of infinity loop art to show that the processes are related to each other and how development and operations is a continuous cycle.

## **MLOps Vs DevOps:**

* MLOps aims to manage deployment of machine learning and deep learning models in large-scale production environments.DevOps aims to shorten development cycles, increase deployment velocity and create dependable releases.
* MLOps is much more experimental in nature that is,different features, parameters, models are tried so that the code base and results need to be managed by the data scientists.
* Due to changing data profiles the model has to be refreshed even if it ‘works’ leading to more iterations in the pipeline.
* The summary statistics of data that built the model needs to be monitored so that we can refresh models when needed.

## **MLOps Tools:**

1. **Neptue:** an ML metadata store built for research and production teams running many experiments.
2. **ML Flow:** an open source platform used for managing the whole machine learning lifecycle.
3. **Comet:** helps view and compare all ML experiments in one place.
4. **Metaflow:** created by Netflix this is an open source platform managing large-scale, enterprise-level data science projects.
5. **Kedro:** a python framework used to create reproducible and maintainable code. 

## **Advantages:**

* MLOps help in deploying Machine Learning models in a fast and easier way. 
* The Machine Learning models deployed by using MLOps can be reused for other use cases.
* Monitoring becomes easy as validation and reporting are integrated into the system.
* Continuous integration and deployment can be done on a MLOp based Machine Learning model.
