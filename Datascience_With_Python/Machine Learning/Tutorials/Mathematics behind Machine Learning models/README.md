# LINEAR REGRESSION
Linear Regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line. We can easily depict linear regression with a simple equation :-<br/>

The purpose of linear regression is to find best fit line. Let's understand this with an example. Suppose we have 3 lines passing in a scatter plot.</br>

For finding best fit line, we have to find the difference between all points and the line and do the summation. The minimum result will be our best fit line.</br>

# LOGISTIC REGRESSION
Logistic Regression is a regression model that used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be extended to model several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc. Each object being detected in the image would be assigned a probability between 0 and 1, with a sum of one. We can easily depict logistic regression with a simple equation :-<br/>

# DECISION TREE
Decision Tree algorithm belongs to the family of supervised learning algorithms. Unlike other supervised learning algorithms, the decision tree algorithm can be used for solving regression and classification problems too.The goal of using a Decision Tree is to create a training model that can use to predict the class or value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from prior data(training data).In Decision Trees, for predicting a class label for a record we start from the root of the tree. We compare the values of the root attribute with the record’s attribute. On the basis of comparison, we follow the branch corresponding to that value and jump to the next node.-<br/>

# RANDOM FOREST
Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in ML. It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model. Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.<br/>
