Contribution Approaches-The method by which we can reduce the number of input variables or features we feed into the model is called Dimensionality Reduction. Often Machine Learning Models can not work properly on a large dataset with too many features. It only reduces the capability of the model to make the best prediction from it's side. Also it is needed for proper data visualization.Here's where Dimensionality Reduction comes to play! Dimensionality Reduction works in such a way that though the number of features fed into a dataset is reduced but still the important information that can be fetched from the datset to be used for feeding into the model is preserved. The most of the important information is retrieved while the information not so needed is discarded. The most commonly used and famous Dimensionality Reduction method is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Sklearn has inbuilt function to implement Principal Component Analysis. The two test cases shows the reduction in features of the dataset. In one test case the dataset was reduced to 2 features from 8 and in the other to 3 features. When we have converted our dataset to a format of reduced dimensions so we have a better version of the dataset. Now we can further use our dataset to use as per our problem statement and if we compare accuracy of our model before and after using PCA then we can realise the improvement in accuracy due to using PCA. There can be also many other alternatives other than PCA.
This even means to reduce the number of features in the dataset. Like reducing a 3d feature problem to a 2d feature problem. 
There are even other methods rather than PCA under Dimensionality Reduction which are as follows->
1) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
2) Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA)

It can be applied on both linear and non linear forms of data. PCA is the most common way for dealing with linear dataset.
