# **Dealing With Categorical Columns**

## **Introduction**


While working with datasets, we might get some categorical columns in it.

Now the question is how do we deal with them ?

Should we drop the entire column or replace or do any other changes!?

Here, we'll look into a dataset as an example and understand how to deal with such categorical columns.

## **Purpose**

The main prupose is to give a clear understanding on how to deal with categorical columns in a dataset, its working, usage, libaries used etc.

## **Brief Explanation**

Categorical columns might hamper the efficiency of a ML model so to deal with it we will be converting categorical columns into numerical columns that will in later steps enhance the efficiency of a ML model using a example dataset with proper code and explanation.

Steps been followed are as:

-  **Step 1: Data Preprocessing and Exploration.**

    This step includes exploring the dataset we will use to understand the shape, columns and their datatypes, memory usage etc.

    This will help us understand our data well.

-  **Step 2: Data Visualization**

    In this step we will visualize the dataset to understand different columns present in the dataset.


-  **Step 3: Data Preparation.**

    In this step we will convert the categorical columns into numerical columns by using a function from pandas.

    And then proceed to prepare the data for model creation ans=d so on.
