They figured out that not all customers are the same, they all have different concerns and different priorities.\n","\n","* While some customers want tickets at a cheaper price while others want good service. This method is now used in all movie booking systems.\n","\n","* There are some parameters, depends on which the price varies, like whether the customer wants to book a ticket in the front row or the back, or the customer wants an executive seat or a couple of seats. \n","\n","* Not only the seats, but prices also depend on where the movie hall is located and which show timing the customer has chosen.\n","\n","* The other way is to come up with discounts or to give users with customized offers for a limited period. In other words, dynamic pricing is a prediction problem, where machine learning is the best tool to tackle it.\n","\n","# Hardware and Software used:\n","\n","* A suitable OS.\n","\n","* A desktop or laptop.\n","\n","* Enough RAM to run the program without any interruption.\n","\n","* Python 3 or upwards installed on your system.\n","\n","# Implementations:\n","\n","* Decide the public you are aiming at.\n","\n","* Mention the type of customer you are aiming.\n","\n","* Collect historical data from on different price points offered in the past as well as the demand for these points.\n","\n","* Build a model to predict the different parameters.\n","\n","* Use an optimization algorithm to discover the optimal price and product features, to maximize the probability of purchasing. This method can also be used for creating product bundles and discounts.\n","\n","\n","# **CODE:**\n","\n","## **IMPLEMENTATION OF MOVIE TICKET PRICING SYSTEM USING PYTHON**\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"IWVbr5Thicu1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635653411078,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":29038,"user":{"displayName":"Robin Rai","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"13041330854742381318"}},"outputId":"0972fe64-bead-4b30-f780-8eea2305d904"},"source":["global f\n","f = 0\n"," \n","#this t_movie function is used to select movie name\n","def t_movie():\n","    global f\n","    f = f+1\n","    print(\"which movie do you want to watch?\")\n","    print(\"1,movie 1 \")\n","    print(\"2,movie 2 \")\n","    print(\"3,movie 3\")\n","    print(\"4,back\")\n","    movie = int(input(\"choose your movie: \"))\n","    if movie == 4:\n","      # in this it goes to center function and from center it goes to movie function and it comes back here and then go to theater\n","      center()\n","      theater()\n","      return 0\n","    if f == 1:\n","      theater()\n"," \n","# this theater function used to select screen\n","def theater():\n","    print(\"which screen do you want to watch movie: \")\n","    print(\"1,SCREEN 1\")\n","    print(\"2,SCREEN 2\")\n","    print(\"3,SCREEN 3\")\n","    a = int(input(\"choose your screen: \"))\n","    ticket = int(input(\"number of ticket do you want?: \"))\n","    timing(a)\n"," \n","# this timing function used to select timing for movie\n","def timing(a):\n","    time1 = {\n","        \"1\": \"10.00-1.00\",\n","        \"2\": \"1.10-4.10\",\n","        \"3\": \"4.20-7.20\",\n","        \"4\": \"7.30-10.30\"\n","    }\n","    time2 = {\n","        \"1\": \"10.15-1.15\",\n","        \"2\": \"1.25-4.25\",\n","        \"3\": \"4.35-7.35\",\n","        \"4\": \"7.45-10.45\"\n","    }\n","    time3 = {\n","        \"1\": \"10.30-1.30\",\n","        \"2\": \"1.40-4.40\",\n","        \"3\": \"4.50-7.50\",\n","        \"4\": \"8.00-10.45\"\n","    }\n","    if a == 1:\n","        print(\"choose your time:\")\n","        print(time1)\n","        t = input(\"select your time:\")\n","        x = time1[t]\n","        print(\"successfull!, enjoy movie at \"+x)\n","    elif a == 2:\n","        print(\"choose your time:\")\n","        print(time2)\n","        t = input(\"select your time:\")\n","        x = time2[t]\n","        print(\"successfull!, enjoy movie at \"+x)\n","    elif a == 3:\n","        print(\"choose your time:\")\n","        print(time3)\n","        t = input(\"select your time:\")\n","        x = time3[t]\n","        print(\"successfull!, enjoy movie at \"+x)\n","    return 0\n"," \n"," \n","def movie(theater):\n","    if theater == 1:\n","        t_movie()\n","    elif theater == 2:\n","        t_movie()\n","    elif theater == 3:\n","        t_movie()\n","    elif theater == 4:\n","        city()\n","    else:\n","        print(\"wrong choice\")\n"," \n"," \n","def center():\n","    print(\"which theater do you wish to see movie?
