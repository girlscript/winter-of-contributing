# Introduction to PyTorch

## Description:
This Tutorial should make you familiar with the basics of PyTorch.

PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library (Torch Library is no longer being developed), used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, developed by Facebook.

## Brief Summary:
In this Notebook you will learn about:
* What is PyTorch?
* How is it different from other libraries with similar functions
* How to operate with PyTorch Tensors
* Difference between using a GPU and a CPU

## Advantages:
* Pythonic in Nature
* Easy to learn
* Easy to customize
* Strong Community
* Easy Debugging
