<h1 align="left">Getting started with Theano</h1>

## Description:
Theano is an open source deep learning library and is basically an hybrid between NUMPY and SYMPY. It is no longer developed but the libraries built on it such as Keras, Lasagne, and Blocks are still being used.
>KERAS - A high-level framework built on top of Theano.

>LASAGNE - A lightweight library to build and train neural networks in Theano.

>BLOCKS - A framework that helps build and manage neural network models using Theano.
## Brief Summary:
A brief summary of what this entails:
* What is Theano?
* Works supported by Theano
* Theano Versus Tensorflow Versus Pytorch
* Theano installation
* Example programs using Theano


## Advantages:
* Theano runs on cross-platform and also provides prallel execution.
* Theano supports almost all other major operating systems and GNUs. 
* It is mainly used for building Deep Learning Projects.
* Theano is mostly used for carrying out mathematical operations involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently.
