## Datascience with Python
### Topic : Introduction to Keras
Issue no: [#416]

## Aim:
      To explain Keras by code snippets and brief theory

## Introduction:

Keras is an open source Neural network library used for deep learning models. It was developed by a google Scientist .It wraps the efficient numerical computation libraries Theano and TensorFlow and allows you to define and train neural network models in just a few lines of code.

### Steps to install Keras:
1.Have Python 2 or 3 installed and configured
2.SciPy (including NumPy) should be installed and configured.
3. Install Keras using this command

      $ pip install keras

 4. Then Load Data for building deep learning model(Load any dataset (csv or excel file) of your choice( i prefer taking dataset from kaggle) ) Read CSV file using pandas dataframe
 5. Perform feature selection , outlier detection( basically data exploration)
 6. Test the model using .test() and compile it
 7. Next , fit the model on training data.
 8. Finally , Evaluate the Neural network model on testing data.

## Advantages of Keras:
 1. They are user friendly
 2. Multiple backend and modularity
 3. Multiple GPU support

## Disadvantages of Keras:
 1.Sometimes there's low level backend errors.
 2.  It is not so good to build some basic machine learning algorithms like clustering and PCM (principal component analysis). It does not have features of dynamic chart creation.

## Uses:
These models can be used for prediction, feature extraction, and fine-tuning.

## Conclusion:

In this documentation , we built a deep learning model using keras and also explained how to install it and use it. I also stated advantages , disadvantages and uses
