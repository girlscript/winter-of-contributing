- Deep learning is one of the major subfield of machine learning framework. 
- Machine learning is the study of design of algorithms, inspired from the model of human brain. 
- Deep learning is becoming more popular in data science fields like robotics, artificial intelligence(AI), audio & video recognition and image recognition.
- Keras is based on minimal structure that provides a clean and easy way to create deep learning models based on TensorFlow or Theano. 
- Keras is designed to quickly define deep learning models. Well, Keras is an optimal choice for deep learning applications.
- Theano and TensorFlow are very powerful libraries but difficult to understand for creating neural networks.

**Features:**
- Consistent, simple and extensible API.
- Minimal structure - easy to achieve the result without any frills.
- It supports multiple platforms and backends.
- It is user friendly framework which runs on both CPU and GPU.
- Highly scalability of computation.

**Benefits:**
- Keras is highly powerful and dynamic framework and comes up with the following advantages âˆ’
- Larger community support.
- Easy to test.
- Keras neural networks are written in Python which makes things simpler.
- Keras supports both convolution and recurrent networks.
- Deep learning models are discrete components, so that, you can combine into many ways.

**Overview:**
- Keras is a high-level neural networks API, capable of running on top of Tensorflow, Theano, and CNTK. 
- It enables fast experimentation through a high level, user-friendly, modular and extensible API. 
- Keras can also be run on both CPU and GPU.
- Keras was developed and is maintained by Francois Chollet and is part of the Tensorflow core, which makes it Tensorflows preferred high-level API.
