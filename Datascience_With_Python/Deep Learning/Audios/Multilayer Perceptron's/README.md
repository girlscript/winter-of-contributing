**Multilayer Perceptron:**
- It is one of the Deep learning models.
- It is a black box technique as it is a automatic feature extraction.
- It learns at each layer.
- At first layer it learns low level information, at hidden layer it learns mid level and high level information.
- At each layer it tries to learn and those are known as representatives.
- It is made up of cells/perceptron.
- It is a fully connected to each perceptron, hence known as dense/fully connected network.
- It is known as multilayered as it has hidden layers which make it different from perceptron algorithm.
- Every cell other than the input cell, has two components:
     - activation component and integration component.

**When it used?**
- It is used when the output is numeric.
- When the inputs are linear or non-linear.

**What are the other names of multilayer perceptron?**
- Fully connected network.
- Dense network.
- Artificial neural network(ANN)

**How does this work?**

- Inputs are passed and then weights are assigned randomly, weights which results in less errors are chosen and then output is given.
- Formula for assignment of weights:
    -weight = weight + learning rate * (expected - predicted) * x
    - X= input

When output is continuous, then output will have a single cell.
When output is discrete and have binary data, then output have a single or binary cells.
When output is discrete and have multiple data, then output have the cells on number of inputs passed.

**Conclusion:**
- Multilayer perceptron is used for both linear and non-linear data sets.
- It has hidden layers.
- It is also used to slove the complex datasets.
