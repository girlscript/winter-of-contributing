- Backpropagation is the essence of neural network training. It is the method of fine-tuning the weights of a neural network based on the error rate obtained in the previous epoch (i.e., iteration). Proper tuning of the weights allows you to reduce error rates and make the model reliable by increasing its generalization.
- Backpropagation in neural network is a short form for “backward propagation of errors.” It is a standard method of training artificial neural networks. This method helps calculate the gradient of a loss function with respect to all the weights in the network.

**Why We Need Backpropagation**
- Backpropagation is fast, simple and easy to program
- It has no parameters to tune apart from the numbers of input
- It is a flexible method as it does not require prior knowledge about the network
- It is a standard method that generally works well
- It does not need any special mention of the features of the function to be learned.

**Types of Backpropagation Networks**
- Two Types of Backpropagation Networks are:
  - Static Back-propagation
  - Recurrent Backpropagation
- Static back-propagation:
  - It is one kind of backpropagation network which produces a mapping of a static input for static output. It is useful to solve static classification issues like optical character recognition.
- Recurrent Backpropagation:
  - Recurrent Back propagation in data mining is fed forward until a fixed value is achieved. After that, the error is computed and propagated backward.
  - The main difference between both of these methods is: that the mapping is rapid in static back-propagation while it is nonstatic in recurrent backpropagation.

**Summary**
- A neural network is a group of connected it I/O units where each connection has a weight associated with its computer programs.
- Backpropagation is a short form for “backward propagation of errors.” It is a standard method of training artificial neural networks
- Back propagation algorithm in machine learning is fast, simple and easy to program
- A feedforward BPN network is an artificial neural network.
- Two Types of Backpropagation Networks are 1)Static Back-propagation 2) Recurrent Backpropagation
- In 1961, the basics concept of continuous backpropagation were derived in the context of control theory by J. Kelly, Henry Arthur, and E. Bryson.
- Back propagation in data mining simplifies the network structure by removing weighted links that have a minimal effect on the trained network.
- It is especially useful for deep neural networks working on error-prone projects, such as image or speech recognition.
- The biggest drawback of the Backpropagation is that it can be sensitive for noisy data.
