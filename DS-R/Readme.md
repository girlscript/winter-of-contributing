<b>R</b> is an open-source programming language  is likely to be behind strong analytics, statistics, and visualisations utilised by data scientists and corporate leaders.The open-source R statistical programming language is used by data scientists all over the world for anything from online trend mapping to constructing financial and climate models that help drive our economies and communities.<br /><br />

**R** was implemented in the early 1990's by **ROBERT GENTLEMEN** & **ROSS IHAKA** at university of *Auckland*, *NEW ZEALND*.The R programming language was based on the S Language for Statistical Computing, which was developed at Bell Labs in the mid-1970s by **John Chambers**, **Rick Becker**, **Trevor Hastie**, **Allan Wilks**, and others and made public in the early 1980s. R was founded as an open source project by Robert and Ross in 1995. The R Core Group has overseen the R project since its inception in 1997. The initial version of R was released in February 2000. Ross Ihaka's description of how R came to be, illustrates some of the R-S relationships.

**S-PLUS** was the nick name given to insightful implementation of the S language, which included a lot of fancy features (primarily GUIs) on top of it.Â *TIBCO* purchased Insightful for $25 million in 2008. As of this writing, *TIBCO* is the sole developer and proprietor of the S programming language.



Every day, Engineers continue to develop new R tools and discover new R applications. Over 10,000 user-generated libraries have been produced to improve R's functionality. These packages have received crowdsourced quality evaluation as well as support from well-known experts in each discipline. All of this is fantastic since R excels at all it does:
> Experts can rapidly and simply comprehend, interact with, and visualize data with R.
