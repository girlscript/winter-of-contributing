<h1 align="center">Functional Components </h1>

**Functional components** are simple **Javascript/ES6 functions** used in React that return _JSX_ code as value and also accept _props_ as parameters if necessary. 
Example: 

```js
function Heading() {
    return (
        <h1>This is a heading! {props.name}</h1>
    );
}
```
We can also use Javascript Arrow Function to create Functional components. 
Example: 

```js
function Heading = () => {
    return (
        <h1>This is a heading! {props.name}</h1>
    );
}
```  

Functional components are also called as **stateless components** because unlike class components, they lack access to dedicated state methods.

However, **React Hooks** enabled the use of states in functional components. React hooks are essentially a new concept for linking class-like behavior to functions by utilizing existing language features.The two basic types of hooks are :

**1. useState() :** useState() allows to hold a local state in functional component. An initial value is stored on the first render and current value is returned on subsequent calls. To access the values which useState() returns in an array, we should use destructuring assignment.
Example :

```js
const [color, setColor] = useState(‘black’)
```

**2. useEffect() :** useEffect() is said to be a combination of three different lifecycle methods -> _componentDidMount_, _componentDidUpdate_ and _componentWillUnmount_. It requires a function as its first parameter, which is set to run once after each render. It can also accept a dependency array as a second parameter. Example :

```js
const [SwitchOn, setSwitchOn] = useState(false)
useEffect(() => {
    setSwitchOn(!SwitchOn)
})
```
Let us see an example of stateful functional component now :

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
 
const Heading = () => {
  return <Headline />;
};

const Headline = () => {
  const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState(
    'Hello World!'
  );
 
  return <h1>{greeting}</h1>;
};
 
export default Heading;
```

## Advantages of Functional Components

**1. Easy to test :** Functional components are definitely easier to test because there are no hidden states to contend with. We can easily predict the HTML output because functional components produce exactly one output for every input i.e. props.

**2. Easy to debug :** Functional components rely solely on the props they are provided for an output. The only thing we need to know is what props are being passed in, with that we can easily trace our code's path and figure out the changes that are taking place. This makes debugging easier.

**3. Easy to read/write :** Functional components are easier to read/write because we already know how much we can't do with functional components.

## Disadvantages of Functional Components

1. Because of the long history of class components, the syntax may appear unusual at first glance and be difficult to grasp. Some variations in functional components in relation to class components can be complicated for other developers to understand if they are not used to writing apps in this manner.

The pros of functional components definitely outweigh its cons. So, we should definitely give functional components a try to create newer apps.
