# React's Class Components VS Functional Components

![React Hooks Logo](https://www.cronj.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/React-Hook.png)

For a newbie (into React) has to make a decision between the two coding architectures for a standard React app architecture. To design an app components, there are two techniques

1. Class Based Components **(Stateful)**
2. Functional Components **(Stateless)**

> Now a BIG QUESTION that you may ask now is that, **What is a [component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html), [state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html), class/functional based components even?**

Well, hold your horses, I shall try my best to explain the vast differences between the two architectures.

Below is a tabular comparison for the two approaches,

| Functional Components                                                                                                     | Class Components                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lifecycle functions (of components) are not available. Use React Hooks to achieve this.                                   | React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components (for example, componentDidMount).                              |
| No render functiona, returns JSX directly in the root function.                                                           | It must have the render() method returning JSX                                                                             |
| A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. | A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element. |

_Well that was a lot of theory, keep an eye below, because I am going to show a basic code snippet for functional and class based components._

```jsx
// ES6 Arrow Function
// Functional Component

const HelloWorld = (props) => {
	return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
};
```

**OR**

```jsx
// Class based components
import React, { Component } from "react";

class HelloWorld extends Component {
	render() {
		return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
	}
}
```

Seeing the above two code snippets, we see that class based components have a special **render** function which is not in **functional components**.
This is one of the biggest structural differences.

## What is a React Lifecycle method?

Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.

The three phases are: **Mounting**, **Updating**, and **Unmounting**.

### Mounting

Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

1.  `constructor()`
2.  `getDerivedStateFromProps()`
3.  `render()`
4.  `componentDidMount()`

The `render()` method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.

> **getDerivedStateFromProps**

The `getDerivedStateFromProps()` method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM.

This is the natural place to set the `state` object based on the initial `props`.

It takes `state` as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the `state`.

The example below starts with the favorite color being "red", but the `getDerivedStateFromProps()` method updates the favorite color based on the `favcol` attribute:

```jsx
class Header extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
		this.state = { buttonClicked: false };
	}
	static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
		return { favoritecolor: props.clicked };
	}
	render() {}
}

ReactDOM.render(<Header clicked />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

> **render**

The `render()` method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM.

```jsx
class Header extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return <h1>This is the content of the Header component</h1>;
	}
}

ReactDOM.render(<Header />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

> componentDidMount

The `componentDidMount()` method is called after the component is rendered.

This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM.

```jsx
class Header extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
		this.state = { buttonClicked: false };
	}
	componentDidMount() {
		setTimeout(() => {
			this.setState({ buttonClicked: true });
		}, 1000);
	}
	static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
		return { favoritecolor: props.clicked };
	}
	render() {}
}
```

> **Updating**

The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is _updated_.

A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's `state` or `props`.

React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

1.  `getDerivedStateFromProps()`
2.  `shouldComponentUpdate()`
3.  `render()`
4.  `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`
5.  `componentDidUpdate()`

The `render()` method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.

> **getDerivedStateFromProps**

Also at _updates_ the `getDerivedStateFromProps` method is called. This is the first method that is called when a component gets updated.

This is still the natural place to set the `state` object based on the initial props.

> **shouldComponentUpdate**

In the `shouldComponentUpdate()` method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not.

The default value is `true`.

> **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate**

In the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` method you have access to the `props` and `state` _before_ the update, meaning that even after the update, you can check what the values were _before_ the update.

If the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` method is present, you should also include the `componentDidUpdate()` method, otherwise you will get an error.

> **componentDidUpdate**

The `componentDidUpdate` method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.

## Unmounting

The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or _unmounting_ as React likes to call it.

React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:

-   `componentWillUnmount()`

> **componentWillUnmount**

The `componentWillUnmount` method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.

## What is State (in React)?

This is a very crucial topic to know about, before you know what stateful and stateless components actually are.

State stores data about the component that can change over time. Change could come in the form of user events or system events such as response to user input or server requests. Working with a state’s component normally involves setting a component’s default state, accessing the current state and updating the state.

## What are React Hooks?

Hooks is an additional API that is coming in the limelight with functional components. It is a blazing fire amongst the React ecosystem since the `v16.8` public release.

React Hooks are in-built functions that allow React developers to use state and lifecycle methods inside functional components, they also work together with existing code, so they can easily be adopted into a codebase. The way Hooks were pitched to the public was that they allow developers to use state in functional components but under the hood, Hooks are much more powerful than that. They allow React Developers to enjoy the following benefits:

-   Improved code reuse;
-   Better code composition;
-   Better defaults;
-   Sharing non-visual logic with the use of custom hooks;
-   Flexibility in moving up and down the `components` tree.

With React Hooks, developers get the power to use functional components for almost everything they need to do from just rendering UI to also handling state and also logic — which is pretty neat.

**To put things simple. Consider Hooks API provide a state to functional components (as they are stateless, being non-object oriented, not wrapped in a class).**

Well, by now you must choose your way, between **class** and **functional** components approach.

Coming to the example as told above, I would like to implement a **button clicked** state storage using both the approaches. This shall enable you to choose as per your comfort.

```jsx
import { Component } from "React";

class ButtonClicked extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props); // Inherited child classes should call parent's constructor.
		this.state = {
			buttonClicked: false,
			clickedTimes: 0,
			avgClickDuration: 0,
		};
	}
	// render() prints the values in the state
	render() {
		{
			for (const stateVal in this.state) {
				<div>
					`${stateVal} : ${this.state[stateVal]}`
				</div>;
			}
		}
	}
}
```

In the class context above,

>     this.state = {
>     			buttonClicked: false,
>     			clickedTimes: 0,
>     			avgClickDuration: 0,
>     };

is the definition of the state. It is an object [key-value] pairs.

You must be puzzled seeing so much code at once, but to comfort you, the above approach gets much more simple when you use functional approach. Let me show you how,

```jsx
const ButtonClicked = () => {
	const [buttonClicked, setButtonClicked] = useState({
		// Default State
		buttonClicked: false,
		clickedTimes: 0,
		avgClickDuration: 0,
	});
};
export default ButtonClicked;
```

Comparing the above two, you must now have decided whether to take Class Components or Functional Components 🤗

In the **functional components syntax**, observe the `[buttonClicked, setButtonClicked]` thing. This is an **array destructuring from** **ES6**, and is widely used with React hooks. The first value returned is the state which is immutable directly, to **mutate this state** we use the second value i.e. **the updation function**. This update function is **setButtonClicked** which will update the state.

> A word of concern, always use the state update function only to update your state.

Now we can conclude that, **Lifecycle Methods of a class** == **React Hooks** (sort of), because the state **management** can be implemented using the **Hooks API**.

In my lifetime experience with React, what I have gained is, that

> Class Components give fine controls over the render, lifecycle of your component. Functional comps. can do these too but with additional hooks.

Please visit [this repository](https://github.com/rehooks/awesome-react-hooks), to explore additional third party hooks that make your development easy.

React 18 is coming!🎉 That is a celebration to come. I urge you to kindly change your mind to get comfortable with Functional Components only with React Hooks as most libraries on **NPM** support React Hooks, and is a much cleaner way of writing code.

That marks an end to the two approaches of rendering a React component. Please let me know your feedbacks in the comments about this article.
