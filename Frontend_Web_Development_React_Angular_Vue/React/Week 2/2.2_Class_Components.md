<h1 align="center">React's Class Components</h1>

## What are Class Components ?
These components are created using [ES6’s class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) syntax. They have some additional features such as the ability to contain logic (for example methods that handle onClick events), local state and other capabilities.

### Example

```js
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

## Create a Class Component
When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter.

The component has to include the `extends React.Component` statement, this statement creates an inheritance to `React.Component`, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

The component also requires a `render()` method, this method returns HTML.

### For Example
Create a Class component called `Car`.

```js
class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}
```

Now your React application has a component called Car, which returns a `<h2>` element.

To use this component in your application, use similar syntax as normal HTML: `<Car />`

Now, Display the `Car` component in the "root" element:

```js
ReactDOM.render(<Car />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Why we use Class Components ?
As you explore other resources, you might find class components referred to as smart, container or stateful components.

- **Class** because they are basically classes

- **Smart** because they can contain logic

- **Stateful** because they can hold and/or manage local state

- **Container** because they usually hold/contain numerous other (mostly functional) components

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Disadvantages of using Class Components

If you ever worked with React you know that it’s always tricky to decide component type. What if you create a functional component, and need a **local state** or any **lifecycle method** to **get data** ? (`componentDidMount()`, `componentWillUnmount()` etc.) It’s annoying !!

Also, class components have downsides:

- **Confusing** (both human and machines, especially at `bind` and `this` keyword)

- **Lifecycle methods**, logic spread over different lifecycle methods

- **Hard to test** compared to functional components

- **Compiled code size** and **compile time**


*Class components have a considerably larger amount of markup. Using them excessively and unnecessarily can negatively affect performance as well as code readability, maintainability and testability.*


<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Function Components
A function component is basically a JavaScript/ES6 function that returns a React element (JSX). According to React's official docs, the function below is a valid functional component:

```js
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
Alternatively, you can also create a functional component with the arrow function definition:

```js
const Welcome = (props) => { 
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>; 
}
```

## Converting a Function to a Class

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="center">Initial (Functional) Component State</h3>

```js
function Clock(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
function tick() {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Clock date={new Date()} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}
setInterval(tick, 1000);
```


However, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the `Clock` sets up a timer and updates the UI every second should be an implementation detail of the `Clock`.
Ideally we want to write this once and have the `Clock` update itself:

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Now, you can convert a function component like `Clock` to a class in five steps:

1. Create an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), with the same name, that extends `React.Component`.
2. Add a single empty method to it called `render()`.
3. Move the body of the function into the `render()` method.
4. Replace `props` with `this.props` in the `render()` body.
5. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="center">Conversion to Class Component</h3>

```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
## Conclusion

Class components are not *dead*. React team explained that:

>There are [no plans](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#gradual-adoption-strategy) to remove classes from React — we all need to keep shipping products and can’t afford rewrites.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**But they suggest trying Hooks for new codes/projects:**

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="font-style: italic;"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One thing that might not be clear: we didn’t immediately embrace Hooks on the React team either. We saw the potential but were skeptical at first. We’ve had the same discussions and concerns too, and didn’t present the proposal until we got more confident in it.</p>&mdash; Dan (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1056669433190469632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Benefits of using Hooks:

- Components are lighter and share some logic between components

- Bundle sizes will reduce

- You don’t need to use HOCs and render props just to pass data

- [Additional Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#additional-hooks) will make your life easier in most cases
