## 1.What is React Dev Tools?

React Developer Tools is a Chrome DevTools extension for the open-source React JavaScript library. 

React developer tools help us smoothly create interactive UIs and React is able to reconcile changes to the DOM in a performant way.

It helps to inspect and edit the React component tree(or component hierarchies) that builds the page, and for each component, one can check the props, the state, hooks, etc.

It works both with React DOM and React Native.

## 2.Why is it needed?

Using React Dev Tools, it is possible to use breakpoints, step-through, and logging to debug a React app. 

Following are the uses:

- Debug performance with the React Profiler
- Detecting whether the application uses React.js:

    Open the application you want to check, now click on the extension tab and then on the        React Developer Tools.

    If the extension remained colorful that means it is built with React.js and if it’s colorless then that means the application hasn’t use React.js

- Access React components and state from the console
