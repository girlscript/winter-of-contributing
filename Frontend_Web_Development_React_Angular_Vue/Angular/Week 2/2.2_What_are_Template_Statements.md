<h1 align="center">Template Statements </h1>

**Template Statements** are statements/methods/properties which can be used in HTML and which respond to a user generated event, i.e. 
```
(event) = {{Statement}}   
```

As events keep updating data as a result of a user-action, that is why the template statements generally have a _side-effect_.
An example of simple assignment statement:-

```
TeamName = 'Dense Eclipse'
```

We may additionally encompass a button in our template and when that button is clicked (or if any another event occurs), then we run the statement.

```
<button (click)="TeamName='Dense Eclipse'"> Team Joined </button>
```
This instructs Angular that when the button click event occurs, assign the new teammate (Dense Eclipse) to the TeamName component property. If the team name was included in the template, it would be shown on the screen.

# Template Syntax

Only with a few exceptions, the syntax of template statements follows similar rules to that of template expressions. The JavaScript and template expression syntaxes listed below are not permitted :

1. new/const
2. Bitwise Operators **-** | and &
3. Assignment Operators **-** += and -=
4. Increment and Decrement Operators **-** ++ and --
5. Unlike expressions, Statements can't use pipe operator to chain to Angular pipes. 

# When And How To Use Angular Statements

* We should always keep template statements simple. Complex logic should be placed in component methods rather than the template statement.

* They neither refer to Global variables like window() or document() nor r.

* Template statements can only be used within the context of a specific template or can also refer to properties of its own template context. 

For example, the event-handling method of component which is onSave(), takes the template's very own $event object as an argument. 

```
content_copy<button (click)="onSave($event)">Save</button>  

```

```
<button *ngFor="let hero of heroes" (click)="deleteHero(hero)">{{hero.name}}</button>  
<form #heroForm (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(heroForm)"> ... </form>  
```
Here, hero is taken as a template input variable by deleteHero() and #heroForm is the template context Variable for onSubmit.

* Template context names take priority over element context names. In the above example- deleteHero(hero), the hero is the template enter variable,it was not the component's hero property. 

These were some of the guidelines that one should follow while using Angular.
