# What is Angular ?

***Angular*** is a **TypeScript** - **based free and open-source web application** **framework**.

It is maintained by **Google** and also a **open** **source** **community**. They used to simply things and also do a testing kind of a stuff . So that they can provide us a bug free environment.

Angular is being used as the frontend of *MEAN* *Stack*, that has *MongoDB* data base, *ExpressJS* servers and *NodeJS* environment and *Angular* itself.

Information - 

Originally, the rewrite of AngularJS was called Angular 2 But it was Confusing for developers. To sort it, Team announced that separate terms should be used for each framework with "AngularJS" referring to the versions 1 and "Angular" referring to versions 2 and up.

It was released on 2012 by a Google employee named as **Misko** **Hevery**.

Every major changes are supported for 18 months. It also consists of 6 months support,  during which regularly-scheduled updates and patches are released.

# Why we use angular ?

1. ***Easy* *to* *learn*** - everyone have knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So it becomes Easier to learn as the language used is already familiar. There are many free courses and AngularJS tutorials available online.
2. ***Real*** ***Time Testing*** feature that is offered by Angular, like dependency injection and how components of web applications are generated. We don’t even need to remember module loading order if you follow “one file-one module” principle.
3. ***Support by Google*** -  It has been used by google for its own applications. Google engineers always come up with improvements in it and also it got its credibility due to google.
4. ***Allows for optimized web applications*** - This framework saves a lot of time as it automatically binds up all the code together that has been broken into different parts. It is easier for developers to manage the UI part of the application.
5. ***Two way Binding Feature*** - It helps in syncing of view and model automatically and immediately. It helps in simplifying its presentation layer.

# Now lets See Some Disadvantages

1. ***Not supported everywhere*** :- AngularJS is not supported by *Internet* *Explorer* *8.0*
2. ***Less secure*** :- It doesn't provide feature of *authorization* and *authentication*  
3. ***Memory leakage*** :- It is done when memory requires by application anymore and after that due to some factors that memory doesn't comeback to that free memory pond. And it causes system slowdown, crashes and high latency.
4. ***JavaScript + TypeScript -Based*** :- Since to use angular you need to have JavaScript installed on your machine. This can be a problem where JavaScript is not available with the OS, which is the case in some and end-users will have to install it in order for angular application development and running the end application.



Hence, We can conclude that there are some disadvantages of it but we have way more advantages, that why it is getting so much popular.
