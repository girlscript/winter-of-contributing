## What is learning?

- Let me take a simple example of what learning means, if we see or listen something and try to remember even a small percentage of what we heard or saw is learning.

- We from our childhood have seen many things and started to learn what it is and now after we become big and see back, we can understand the process from where we came to where we are now, its all just a transition of learning.


## Now let’s understand what is machine learning?

- A simple and the easiest answer would be a machine trying to learn something and make decisions as humans do is known as machine learning.

## Why Is Machine Learning Important?

•	Data is the lifeblood of all business.

•	Data-driven decisions increasingly make the difference between keeping up with competition or falling further behind. 

•	Machine learning can be the key to unlocking the value of corporate and customer data and enacting decisions that keep a company ahead of the competition.


## Some of the use cases of Machine Learning 

•	**Manufacturing.** Predictive maintenance and condition monitoring

•**Retail.** Upselling and cross-channel marketing

•	**Healthcare and life sciences.** Disease identification and risk satisfaction

•	**Travel and hospitality.** Dynamic pricing

•	**Financial services.** Risk analytics and regulation

•	**Energy.** Energy demand and supply optimization 

## Now lets understand that there are two types of programming in a machine:

- Traditional programming is just about the data and we give program to get an output.

- But machine learning is something where machine learns from the past data and give us a program as an output so that next time when we want to take a decision we get the output directly instead of we humans going through the data and again writing programs. 

## Conclusion:

- The current era is just running behind technologies and we are at phase to use it in each part of our life and Machine learning is becoming the heart of new technolgies as it is just simply intelligent as anyone of us.
