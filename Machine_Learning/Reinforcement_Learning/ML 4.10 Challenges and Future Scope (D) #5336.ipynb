For instance, while there has been much focus on the role reinforcement learning had in the development of AlphaGo, what is less well known is AlphaGo’s training started with Monte Carlo methods and deep neural networks, during which time it learnt from 30 million moves from expert human players.  Reinforcement learning was only applied after this extensive initial training.  Further, after the reinforcement learning phase, moves from those games were then fed into a second neural network.  In other words, reinforcement learning only played a part (albeit important part) in the success of AlphaGo – it was not the entire solution.\n",
