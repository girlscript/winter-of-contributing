## **Contrast in Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning**

- Supervised learning - Supervised learning (SL) is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.
- Unsupervised Learning - Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets.
- Reinforcememt learning - Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in 
  order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward
