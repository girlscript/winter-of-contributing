        "The State–action–reward–state–action (SARSA) algorithm is a machine learning reinforcement learning technique for learning a Markov decision process policy.\n",
        "\n",
        "This name simply reflects the fact that the main function for updating the Q-value is dependent on the agent's current state \"S1,\" the action \"A1,\" the reward \"R\" the agent receives for taking that action, the state \"S2\" that the agent enters after that action, and finally the next action \"A2\" the agent chooses in its new state.\n",

        "The main advantage of SARSA is that, the reward/penalty of an action can be updated after each state, and need not wait till the end of the episode."

        "1. On Policy: In this case, the learning agent learns the value function based on the current action as determined by the policy in use.\n",

        "QL and SARSA are both excellent initial approaches for reinforcement learning problems. A few key notes to select when to use QL or SARSA:\n",
        "1. Both approach work in a finite environment (or a discretized continuous environment)\n",
        "2. QL directly learns the optimal policy while SARSA learns a “near” optimal policy. QL is a more aggressive agent, while SARSA is more conservative. An example is walking near the cliff. QL will take the shortest path because it is optimal (with the risk of falling), while SARSA will take the longer, safer route (to avoid unexpected falling).\n",
        "3. In practice, if you want to fast in a fast-iterating environment, QL should be your choice. However, if mistakes are costly (unexpected minimal failure — robots), then SARSA is the better option.\n",
        "4. If your state space is too large, try exploring the deep q network. I will hopefully write up a post about this topic soon. Stay tuned!"

        "2. **A reinforcement learning approach to the shepherding task using SARSA:** In this a reinforcement learning model of the shepherding of a flock of sheep by a dog is used. The shepherding task, a heuristic model originally proposed by Strombom, et al., describes the dynamics of the sheep while being herded by a dog to a predefined target. This study recreates the proposed model using SARSA, an algorithm for learning the optimal policy in reinforcement learning. Results show that with a discretized state and action space, the dog is able to successfully herd a flock of a sheep to the target position by first learning to reach a subgoal. A reward is awarded when the dog reaches the neighbourhood of a subgoal, while a penalty is incurred for each time the shepherding task is not completed. The stochasticity of the interaction among sheep and dog, including the existence of multiple subgoals affect the learning time of the agent. \n",
