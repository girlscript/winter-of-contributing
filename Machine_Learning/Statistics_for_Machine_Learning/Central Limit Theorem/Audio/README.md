Topic: Central Limit Theorem

What is it?: 

It is one of the fundamental topics in statistics. The central limit theorem states that, given a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the mean for a variable will approximate a normal distribution regardless of that variable’s distribution in the population.

Detailed Explanation: 

Let’s break the definition to clearly understand.
Part of the definition for the central limit theorem states, “regardless of the variable’s distribution in the population.” This part is easy to understand. It just means that in a population, the values of a variable can follow different probability distributions. These distributions can range from normal, left-skewed, right-skewed, and uniform among others.

The definition for the central limit theorem also refers to “the sampling distribution of the mean.” Typically, you perform a study once, and you might calculate the mean of that one sample. Now, imagine that you repeat the study many times and collect the same sample size for each one. Then, you calculate the mean for each of these samples and graph them on a histogram. The histogram displays the distribution of sample means, which statisticians refer to as the sampling distribution of the mean.

And, the definition of the central limit theorem also states that when you have a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution starts to approximate a normal distribution. You may question how large does the sample size have to be for that approximation to occur? It depends on the shape of the variable’s distribution in the underlying population. The more the population distribution differs from being normal, the larger the sample size must be. Typically, statisticians say that a sample size of 30 is sufficient for most distributions. However, strongly skewed distributions can require larger sample sizes. 

It’s not surprising that a normally distributed variable produces a sampling distribution that also follows the normal distribution. But, surprisingly, nonnormal population distributions can also create normal sampling distributions.Central Limit Theorem is an approximation you can use when the population you’re studying is so big, it would take a long time to gather data about each individual that’s part of it.

Real-life examples:

If a company like Coca-Cola wants to know if their Indian customers will like the new product they are developing, talking to every single person in India would be very expensive and would take a long time to collect all the data.That’s why companies do user studies with several groups of people that represent of their product’s audience, their population, so they can gather data and determine if it’s worth moving forward with product development. All of this, without talking to the entire population.So, in statistical terms, you’re going to collect samples from your population, and by combining the information from the samples you can draw conclusions about your population.

Another real life application would be suppose you’re the regional manager at a grocery chain, in charge of 350 stores in the region, and the next project you’re going to take on is to optimize the weekly re-stocking of cold drink cans.You want to know many cold drink cans to order weekly, for each store, so you minimize the amount of inventory that ends up sitting idle in store shelves.You know there has to be a better way to get to a plausible answer that doesn’t involve visiting every single store in your region and get their sales numbers every single week.Here, the Central Limit Theorem comes to action. You know that the Central Limit Theorem helps you balance the time and cost of collecting all the data you need to draw conclusions about the population.The Central Limit Theorem tells you that we don’t have to visit every single store in the region and get their cold drink cans sales numbers for the week to know how many cases to put in the next order. What you can do is collect many samples from weekly sales in your stores (the population), calculate their mean (the average number of cold drink cans sold) and build the distribution of the sample means. This distribution is also referred to as sampling distribution.If these samples meet Central Limit Theorem’s criteria, you can assume the distribution of the sample means can be approximated to the Normal distribution. So now you can use all the statistical tools the Normal distribution provides. From this point on, since you know the distribution at hand, you can calculate probabilities and confidence intervals, and perform statistical tests.

The samples must meet a specific set of criteria before you use the Central Limit Theorem
The samples should be:
1. Picked at random, so you’re not biased towards certain characteristics in the population and you guarantee each observation in the sample is independent of all other observations. This also helps enforce that each observation in the sample is independent.
2. Representative of the population.
3. Big enough to draw conclusions from, which in statistics is a sample size greater or equal to 30.

Include less than 10% of the population, if you’re sampling without replacement. Since observations in the population are not all independent of each other, if you collect a sample that is too big you may end up collect observations that are not independent of each other. Even if those observations were picked at random.
