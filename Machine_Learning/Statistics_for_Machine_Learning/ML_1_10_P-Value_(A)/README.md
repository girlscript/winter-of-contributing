Probabilistic or P Value is a numerical value in statistics that will describe how likely a data can have occured by a random chance. This has high relation with 
Hypothesis Testing concept in Statisics. Under this we have 2 concepts called Null Hypothesis, Alternative Hypothesis.
Suppose in a problem statement we assume that outcome is true as a part of Null Hypothesis. If evidences in the dataset show that outcome will be false then
we will reject the Null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. But if evidences in the dataset show that outcome is true then we will accept the
null hypothesis. 
P value is represented by a graph of probabilistic distribution of any particular observation vs set of possible observation. In this case p value is found
mathematically with the help of integral calculus & area under the curve. 
Once we find p value in a case (this will now act as an evidence to decide whether we should choose or reject null hypothesis)-

if p value<0.05 then

we must reject Null Hypothesis and accept Alternative Hypothesis (there is strong evidence that Null hypothesis is wrong)

if p value>0.05 then

we can accept Null Hypothesis (there is strong evidence that Null hypothesis is right)
